<p class="drop-capx">The life of the distinguished humourist whose <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">opera
minora</i> we now present to the world, was so chequered
and diversified by remarkable incidents and adventures, and
passed so much in the broad eye of the world and of society,
as to be more than ordinarily interesting. The biography
of a man of letters in modern times seldom affords so entertaining
a narrative, or so instructive and pathetic a lesson,
exhibiting how useless and futile are the most brilliant
powers and talents, both original and transmitted, without
a due admixture of that moral principle and wisdom in daily
life necessary to temper and control them.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Theodore Edward Hook</span>&mdash;one of the most brilliant wits,
and one of the most successful novelists of this century&mdash;was
born in London, at Charlotte Street, Bedford Square, on
the 22nd of September, 1788, in the same year as Lord Byron,
whose contemporary he afterwards was at Harrow. The
first school that Theodore attended was an "academy," in
the Vauxhall districts. The master, a Mr. Allen, had also
other pupils in his charge who afterwards rose to eminence.
Here he remained till his tenth year, when he was sent to a
kind of seminary for young gentlemen, a green-doored, brass-plated
establishment, in Soho Square. While at this school,
he appears systematically to have played truant, to have
employed his time in wandering about the streets, and to
have invented ingenious excuses to explain his absence to
the authorities. On the day of the illumination for the Peace<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[4]</a></span>
of Amiens, he preferred to spend the morning at home, and
informed his parents that a whole holiday had been given on
account of the general rejoicings. Unfortunately, his elder
brother, James, happened to pass through the Square, and
observing signs of business going on as usual at the academy,
he went in, made inquiries, and found that the young scape-grace
had not made his appearance there for three weeks.
Theodore, instead of witnessing the fireworks, was duly
punished, and locked up in the garret for the rest of the
afternoon.</p>

<p>Theodore was the second son of Mr. James Hook, the
popular musical composer, whose pleasing strains had delighted
the preceding generation, when Vauxhall Garden
was a fashionable resort. His mother (a Miss Madden) is
described as a woman of singular beauty, talents,<a name="FNanchor_1" id="FNanchor_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> accomplishments,
and worth. To the fact that he lost her gentle
guidance at the early age of fourteen, may be attributed
many of the misfortunes and irregularities of his after-life.</p>

<p>There was but one other child of Mr. James Hook's first
marriage, the late Dr. James Hook, Dean of Worcester; and
he being Theodore's senior by eighteen years, had left the
paternal roof long before the latter was sent to school.</p>

<p>The Dean, with a great deal of the wit and humour that
made his brother famous,<a name="FNanchor_2" id="FNanchor_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> and with perhaps much the same
original cast of disposition and temper generally, had possessed
one great advantage over him at the start of life.
His excellent mother watched over him all through the years
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[5]</a></span>of youth and early manhood. Theodore could only remember
her, and fondly and tenderly he did so to the last, as the
gentle parent of a happy child. He had just approached
the first era of peril when this considerate and firm-minded
woman was lost to her family. The composer soon afterwards
married again; but Theodore found not, what, in spite
of a thousand proverbs, many men have found under such
circumstances&mdash;a second mother. But for that deprivation
we can hardly doubt that he might, like his more fortunate
brother, have learned to regulate his passions and control
his spirits, and risen to fill with grace some high position in
an honourable profession. The calamitous loss of his mother
is shadowed very distinctly in one of his novels, and the
unlucky hero (Gilbert Gurney) is represented as having a
single prosperous brother, exactly eighteen years older than
himself. But, indeed, that novel is very largely autobiographical:
when his diary alludes to it as in progress, the
usual phrase is, "Working at my Life."</p>

<p>Born in the same year with Lord Byron and Sir Robert
Peel, he was their schoolfellow at Harrow, but not in the
same memorable form, though he often alluded to the coincidence
of dates with an obvious mixture of pride and regret&mdash;perhaps
we ought to say, remorse.</p>

<p>We have met with no account of him whatever by any one
who knew him familiarly at that period. That he was as careless
and inattentive to the proper studies of the place, as he
represents his Gurney to have been, will not be thought improbable
by most of his readers. But his early performances,
now forgotten, display many otiose quotations from the
classics, and even from the modern Latin poets; and these
specimens of juvenile pedantry must be allowed to indicate
a vein of ambition which could hardly have failed, with a
mind of such alacrity, to produce some not inconsiderable
measure of attainment.</p>

<p>His entrance at Harrow was signalized by the perpetration
of a practical joke, which might have been attended with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[6]</a></span>
serious consequences. On the night of his arrival, he was
instigated by young Byron, whose contemporary he was, to
throw a stone at a window where an elderly lady, Mrs. Drury,
was undressing. Hook instantly complied; but, though
the window was broken, the lady happily escaped unhurt.
Whatever degree of boyish intimacy he might at this time
have contracted with his lordship, it was not sufficient to
preserve him from an ill-natured and uncalled-for sneer in
the "English Bards and Scotch Reviewers," an aggression
amply repaid by the severe strictures which appeared in the
<cite>John Bull</cite> on certain of the noble bard's effusions, and on
the "Satanic school of poetry" in general. The acquaintance,
such as it was, was broken off by Hook's premature
withdrawal from Harrow, and does not appear to have been
resumed.</p>

<p>In 1802, his excellent mother died, and with her perished
the only hope of restraining the youthful Theodore within
those bounds most essential to be preserved at his age, and of
maintaining him in that course of study, which, if persevered
in for a few years more, might have enabled him to reach a
position not less honourable than that enjoyed by his more
prosperous brother. Mrs. Hook appears, indeed, to have
been one of those best of wives and women, who, by the
unobtrusive and almost unconscious exercise of a superior
judgment, effect much towards preserving the position and
respectability of a family constantly imperilled by the indiscretion
of its head&mdash;one who, like a sweet air wedded to
indifferent words, serves to disguise and compensate for the
inferiority of her helpmate.</p>

<p>Theodore's father, a clever but weak man, was easily
persuaded not to send him back to Harrow. He was proud
already of his boy, found his company at home a great solace
at first, and even before the house received its new mistress,
had begun to discover that one of his precocious talents
might be turned to some account financially. Theodore had
an exquisite ear, and was already, living from the cradle in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[7]</a></span>
a musical atmosphere, an expert player on the pianoforte;
his voice was rich, sweet, and powerful; he could sing a
pathetic song well, a comic one charmingly. One evening
he enchanted his father especially by his singing, to his own
accompaniment, two new ballads, one grave and one gay.
Whence the airs&mdash;whence the words? It turned out that
verse and music were alike his own: in the music the
composer perceived much that might be remedied, but the
verses were to him faultless&mdash;meaning probably not much,
but nothing more soft than the liquid flow of the vocables,
nothing more easy than the balance of the lines. Here was
a mine for the veteran artist; hitherto he had been forced to
import his words; now the whole manufacture might go on
at home. Snug, comfortable, amiable domestic arrangement!
The boy was delighted with the prospect&mdash;and at
sixteen his fate was fixed.</p>

<p>In the course of the following six years Theodore Hook
produced at least a dozen vaudevilles, comic operas, and
dramatic pieces for the stage, which all enjoyed a considerable
run of popularity in their time, but are now entirely,
and perhaps deservedly, forgotten. His <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">coup-d'essai</i> in this
line appeared in 1805, under the title of "The Soldier's
Return; or, What can Beauty do? a comic opera in two
acts, as performed at the Theatre Royal, Drury Lane."</p>

<p>It would be as absurd to criticise such a piece as last
year's pantomime&mdash;like that, it answered its purpose and its
author's, and no more is to be said. At the same time,
amidst all its mad, impudent nonsense, there are here and
there jokes which, if unborrowed, deserved the applause of
the pit. A traveller coming up to an inn-door, says, "Pray,
friend, are you the master of this house?" "Yes, sir,"
answers Boniface, "my wife has been dead these three
weeks." We might quote one or two more apparently genuine
Theodores. The dialogue, such as it is, dances along, and
the songs read themselves into singing.</p>

<p>His <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">modus operandi</i> in producing this earliest piece, was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span>
ingenious. He bought three or four French vaudevilles,
filched an incident from each, and thus made up his drama.</p>

<p>The production of this little piece brought the young
author into contact with Mathews and Liston. These distinguished
comedians were both considerably his seniors.
Both had their own peculiar style, and yet both seemed at
their best when treading the boards together. With the
view of providing an opportunity for their joint appearance,
Theodore Hook planned his second afterpiece, "Catch Him
who Can" (1806), in which abundant opportunity was contrived
for exhibiting the grave irresistible drollery of Liston
in contrast with the equally matchless vivacity and versatility
of the prince of mimics and ventriloquists. In the course of
the farce Mathews figured in, we think, seven different disguises.
Such acting would have insured the triumph of
even a worse thing than the "Soldier's Return,"&mdash;but this
was better than that in every respect. One of Liston's songs
was long in vogue, perhaps still survives&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<p class="verse">"I sing the loves, the smiling loves,</p>
<p class="verse4">Of Clutterbuck and Higginbottom."</p>
</div></div></div>

<p>There are three other readable songs, "Mary," "Donna
Louisa Isabella," and the "Blacksmith," and not a few
meritorious points in the dialogue. It is impossible, however,
as we have already hinted, to be sure of the originality
of anything either in the plot or the dialogue of these early
pieces. Hook pilfers with as much audacity as any of his
valets, and uses the plunder occasionally with a wonderful
want of thought. Liston's sweetheart, for instance, a tricky
chambermaid, knocks him down with Pope's famous saying,
"Every man has just as much vanity as he wants understanding."</p>

<p>"The Invisible Girl" next followed (1806). The idea appears
to have been taken from a newspaper account of a new
French vaudeville;<a name="FNanchor_3" id="FNanchor_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a> but it was worked out by the adapter
with very great cleverness.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span></p>
<p>The fun is, that with a crowd of <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">dramatis personæ</i>, a rapid
succession of situations, and even considerable complication
of intrigue, no character ever gets out more than <em>yes</em>, <em>no</em>, a
<em>but</em>, a <em>hem</em>, or a <em>still</em>&mdash;except the indefatigable hero Captain
Allclack&mdash;for whose part it is difficult to believe that any
English powers but Jack Bannister's in his heyday could
ever have been adequate. This affair had a great run; and
no wonder. If anybody could play the Captain now, it
would fill the house for a season. Under a somewhat
altered form, and with the title of "Patter <em>versus</em> Clatter," it
has indeed been reproduced by Mr. Charles Mathews, with
great success.</p>

<p>In the following year (1807) a drama, by Hook, in three
acts, entitled "The Fortress," and also taken from the
French, was produced at the Haymarket. As a fair specimen
of the easy jingle with which these pieces abounded, we
select a song sung by Mathews, in the character of Vincent,
a gardener, much in vogue in its day:&mdash;</p>

<p>"The Siege of St. Quentin," a drama of a similar description,
quickly followed. The plot was founded on the famous
battle of that name fought in 1557, when the French, endeavouring
to raise the siege, were signally defeated. The
object of the piece, which was to excite enthusiasm in
favour of the Spanish nation, together with the magnificence
of the <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">mise en scène</i>, won for it considerable success. It
sleeps now with sundry others, such as "The Trial by Jury"
(1811), "Darkness Visible" (1811), "Safe and Sound"
(1809), "Music Mad" (1808). They all ran their course, and
have perished&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<p class="verse">"Unwept, unhonour'd, and unknown."</p>
</div></div></div>

<p class="noindent">The last-named, however ("Music Mad"), perhaps deserves
a word of notice, if only on account of its transcendent absurdity.
The principal character, stolen bodily from <cite>Il
Fanatico per la Musica</cite> (which had been considered the
masterpiece of the celebrated Naldi), and rendered infinitely
more ridiculous by being metamorphosed into a native of our
most unmusical isle, is, as the title indicates, an amateur, and
so passionately devoted to his favourite science as to insist
upon his servant's wearing a waistcoat scored all over with
crotchets and semiquavers.</p>

<p>In 1809, the destruction by fire of the two patent houses
having compelled the rival companies to coalesce and repair to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span>
the Lyceum, principally for the purpose of providing employment
for the humbler members of the profession, Theodore
Hook contributed the well-known after-piece of "Killing no
Murder." Apart from the intrinsic merit of the piece itself,
the admirable acting of Liston as Apollo Belvi, and of
Mathews as Buskin, for whom it was especially written
(though, by the way, it is but justice to add, on the authority
of Mrs. Mathews, that the latter character was but "a sketch,
which Mr. Mathews filled up <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">ad libitum</i>"),&mdash;there were circumstances
attending its representation which invested it
with peculiar interest, and enlisted all the sympathies of the
audience in favour of the author. It appears that on the
MS. being submitted to the deputy-licenser, Mr. Larpent,
certain passages reflecting on the Methodist preachers induced
that gentleman, in the first instance, to place a veto
on the performance. A compromise, however, was effected,
the objectionable scene remodelled, and the play allowed to
proceed. Whether it would have been wiser, upon the
whole, to have suffered it to go forth with its imperfections
on its head, and to have trusted to the good taste of the
public to demand the suppression of any incidental improprieties,
may be a question, the more so, as the licenser's
authority, extending only to the acted drama, could offer no
hindrance to its publication. Some half-dozen editions, containing
the passages omitted in the performance, were struck
off and circulated like wildfire, together with a preface,
from which, as the author has thus an opportunity of stating
his own case, it may be as well to present our readers with
a few extracts:&mdash;</p>

<p>"I should have suffered my gratitude to the public to
have been felt, not told, had not some very singular circumstances
compelled me to explain part of my conduct, which,
if I remained silent, might be liable to misconstruction. On
the evening previous to the performance of 'Killing no
Murder,' I was much surprised to hear that it could not be
produced, because Mr. Larpent, the reader of plays (as he is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span>
termed), had refused to grant his license for it. The cause
of the refusal was, I heard, political. I revolted at the idea;
and, as a young man entering life, felt naturally anxious to
clear my character from the imputation of disloyalty. Then
I heard it rumoured that the ground of the refusal was its
immorality. Here again I was wounded; for though I confess
I have no pretension to sanctity, yet I hope I shall never
prostitute my time in the production of that for which even
wit itself is no excuse.</p>

<p>"Thus situated, I set off in search of the gentleman who
had strangled my literary infant in its birth; and to find
him I referred to the 'Red-book,' where I discovered that
John Larpent, Esq., was <em>clerk</em> at the Privy Seal Office, that
John Larpent, Esq., was <em>deputy</em> to John Larpent, Esq., and
that the <em>deputy's secretary</em> was John Larpent, Esq. This
proved to me that a man could be in three places at once;
but on inquiry, I found he was even in a fourth and a fifth,
for it was by virtue of none of these offices he licensed plays,
and his place, <em>i.e.</em>, his villa, was at Putney. Thither I proceeded
in a post-chaise, in chase of this ubiquitarian deputy,
and there I found him. After a seasonable delay to beget
an awful attention on my part, he appeared, and told me
with a chilling look, that the second act of my farce was a
most 'indecent and shameful attack on a very religious and
harmless set of people' (he meant the Methodists), 'and
that my farce altogether was an infamous persecution of
the sectaries.' Out came the murder. The character of a
Methodist preacher, written for Liston's incomparable talents,
with the hope of turning into ridicule the ignorance and
impudence of the self-elected pastors, who infest every
part of the kingdom, met with the reprehension of the
licenser.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>"It was in vain I adduced Mother Cole in the 'Minor,'
Mawworm in the 'Hypocrite,' Barebones in the 'London
Hermit,' and half-a-dozen other parts. The great licenser<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span>
shook his head 'as if there was something in it,' and told
me that Lord Dartmouth had the piece; if he did not object,
it might yet be played; but if his lordship concurred
with him, not a line should be performed. I took my leave,
fully convinced how proper a person Mr. Larpent was to
receive, in addition to his other salaries, four hundred pounds
per annum, besides perquisites, for reading plays, the pure
and simple performance of which, by his creed, is the acme
of sin and unrighteousness. His even looking at them is
contamination&mdash;but four hundred a-year&mdash;a sop for Cerberus&mdash;what
will it not make a man do?</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>"Now, in defence of the part of 'Apollo Belvi,' as originally
written, I consider it necessary to speak. It is a
notorious fact that the Methodists are not contented with
following their own fashions in religion, but they endeavor
hourly to overturn the Established Church by all means,
open and covert; and I know, as a positive fact, that it is
considered the first duty of Methodist parents to irritate
their children against the regular clergy, before the poor
wretches are able to think or consider for themselves. Nay,
they are so ingenious in their efforts for this purpose, that
they inculcate the aversion by nick-naming whatever object
the children hate most after some characteristic of the
Episcopal religion; and I have known a whole swarm of
sucking Methodists frightened to bed by being told that the
<em>bishop</em> was coming&mdash;the impression resulting from this alarm
grows into an antipathy, and from having been, as children,
accustomed to consider a bishop as a bugbear, it became no
part of their study to discover why&mdash;the very mention of
lawn sleeves throws them into agonies ever after. Seeing,
then, with what zeal these sectaries attack us, and with what
ardour they endeavour to widen the breach between us by
persecution and falsehood, I did conceive that the lash of
ridicule might be well applied to their backs, particularly as
I prefer this open mode of attack to the assassin-like stab of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span>
the dagger, to which the cowardly Methodist would, for our
destruction, have no objection to resort.</p>

<p>"But my ridicule went to one point only. Mr. L. Hunt,
in his admirable Essays on Methodism, justly observes, that
a strong feature in the Methodists' character is a love of
preaching. If it be possible that these self-elected guardians
and ministers have an ascendency over the minds of their
flocks, and have the power to guide and direct them, it becomes
surely the duty of every thinking being to consider
their qualifications for such a task.</p>

<p>"The wilful misleadings of the clever Methodists, from
the small proportion of talent that exists among them, are
more harmless in their tendency than the blasphemous doctrines
of ignorance. The more illiterate the preacher, the
more infatuated the flock; and there is less danger in the
specious insinuation of a refined mind than the open
and violent expressions of inspired tailors and illuminated
cobblers. It was to ridicule such monstrous incongruities,
that, without any claim to originality, I sketched the part of
'Belvi,' in the following farce. I conceived, by blending
the most flippant and ridiculous of all callings, except a man-milliner's
(I mean a dancing-master's), with the grave and
important character of a preacher, I should, without touching
indelicately on the subject, have raised a laugh against the
absurd union of spiritual and secular avocations, which so
decidedly marks the character of the Methodist. Of the
hypocrisy introduced into the character, I am only sorry
that the lightness of the farce prevented my displaying a
greater depth of deception. All I can say is, that, whatever
was written in 'Killing no Murder,' against the Methodists,
was written from a conviction of their fallacy, their deception,
their meanness, and their profaneness."</p>

<p>Another farce, "Exchange no Robbery," produced at a
somewhat later period, under the pseudonym of "Richard
Jones," deserves honourable mention. Terry, another intimate
associate from that time forth, had in Cranberry a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span>
character excellently adapted to his saturnine aspect and
dry humour; and Liston was not less happily provided for
in Lamotte.</p>

<p>Almost all these pieces were written before Hook was
twenty years of age. Had he gone on in this successful
dramatic career, and devoted to such productions the experience
of manhood and that marvellous improvisatore power
which was to make him the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">facile princeps</i> of the satirists
and humourists of his time, there can be no doubt he must
have rivalled any farce-writer that ever wrote in any language.</p>

<p>It was in his twentieth year that Theodore Hook made
his first appearance as a novelist, under the pseudonym of
Alfred Allendale.<a name="FNanchor_4" id="FNanchor_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a> Lockhart characterizes the work as "a
mere farce, though in a narrative shape and as flimsy as any
he had given to the stage. As if the set object," he says,
"had been to satirize the Minerva Press School, everything,
every individual turn in the fortunes of his 'Musgrave' is
brought about purely and entirely by accident." The sentimental
hero elopes with his mistress. A hundred miles down
the North road they stop for a quarter of an hour&mdash;order
dinner, and stroll into the garden. Behold, the dreaded
rival happens to be lodging here&mdash;he is lounging in the
garden at this moment. The whole plan is baulked.
Some time afterwards they elope again&mdash;and reach Gretna
Green in safety.</p>

<div class="blockquotx">

<p>"Cruel mothers, chattering friends, and flattering rivals
all were distanced&mdash;the game was run down, he was in at
the death, and the brush was his own. False delicacy
at Gretna is exploded; a woman when she goes into Lanchester's
is known to want millinery (people say something
more), when she lounges at Gray's she is understood to stand
in need of trinkets, when she stops at Gattie's she wants complexion,
and when she goes to Gretna she wants a husband.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span></p>
<p>"That being the case, <em>not</em> to talk of marriage is as absurdly
<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">outré</i> as not to call for supper, and therefore Musgrave with
a sly look at his blushing bride, ordered a couple of roasted
fowls and a parson to be ready immediately; the waiter,
perfect in his part, stepped over to the chandler's shop, hired
the divine, and at half-past ten the hymeneal rites were to
be solemnized."&mdash;Vol. i., p. 84.</p>
</div>

<p>The fowls are put to the fire&mdash;the blacksmith appears&mdash;the
ceremony has just reached the essential point, when a
chaise dashes up to the door&mdash;out spring the heroine's
mother and the rival again. Farther on, the hero comes
late at night to an inn, and is put into a double-bedded
room, in which the rival happens to be deposited, fast
asleep. The rival gets up in the morning before the hero
awakes, cuts his thumb in shaving, walks out, sees a creditor,
jumps on the top of a passing stage-coach, and vanishes.
The hero is supposed to have murdered him&mdash;the towel is
bloody&mdash;he must have contrived to bury the body; he is
tried, convicted, condemned;&mdash;he escapes&mdash;an accident
brings a constable to the cottage where he is sheltered&mdash;he
is recaptured&mdash;pinioned&mdash;mounts the drop; he is in the act
of speaking his last speech, when up dashes another post-chaise
containing the rival, who had happened to see the
trial just the morning before in an old newspaper. And so
on through three volumes.</p>

<p>It abounds, as a matter of course, in play upon words:
for example, a rejected suitor's taking to drinking, is accounted
for on the plea that "it is natural an unsuccessful
lover should be given to whine,"&mdash;a pun, by the way, better
conveyed in the name "Negus," which he is said to have
bestowed upon a favourite, but offending, dog. There are
also introduced a couple of tolerably well-sketched portraits,
<em>Mr. Minns</em>, the poet (T. Moore), and <em>Sir Joseph Jonquil</em>
(Banks). An epigram, referring to the celebrated duel of
the former with Jeffrey, in consequence of an article in
No. 16 of the <cite>Edinburgh Review</cite>, is worth repeating,&mdash;the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span>
more so, as its paternity has been subject of dispute, the
majority attributing it to one of the authors of "Rejected
Addresses!"&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<p class="verseq">"When Anacreon would fight, as the poets have said,</p>
<p class="verse4">A reverse he displayed in his vapour,</p>

<p class="verse4">His pistols were loaded with paper;</p>
<p class="verse">For excuses Anacreon old custom may thank,</p>

<p class="verse">For the cartridge, by rule, is always made blank,</p>
<p class="verse4">Which is fired away at <em>Reviews</em>."</p>
</div></div></div>

<p>But the oddest part of the whole is that Hook himself,
sixteen years afterwards, thought it worth while to re-cast
precisely the same absurd fable, even using a great deal of
the language, in his "Sayings and Doings." (Series first, vol.
iii. <em>Merton</em>.) Of course the general execution of that tale is
vastly superior to the original edition; but some of, all
things considered, its most remarkable passages are transcribed
almost <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">literatim</i>.</p>

<p>Mr. Allendale's novel excited little or no attention, and
remained unacknowledged. It is worthless, except that in
the early filling up occasionally we have glimpses of the
author's early habits and associations, such as he was in no
danger of recalling from oblivion in the days of "Sayings and
Doings." When the hero fell in love, for example, "Bond-street
lounges became a bore to him&mdash;he sickened at the
notion of a jollification under the Piazza&mdash;the charms of the
pretty pastry-cooks at Spring Gardens had lost their piquancy."
A Viscountess's fête at Wimbledon has all the appearance
of having been sketched after a <em>lark</em> at Vauxhall with a
bevy of singing women. In the re-cast, it is right to say, he
omitted various gross indecencies, some rude personalities,
and a very irreverent motto.<a name="FNanchor_5" id="FNanchor_5"></a><a href="#Footnote_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a></p>

<p>Of such an ephemeral character were the earlier writings
of a man whose later works have charmed and delighted
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span>thousands wherever the English language is spoken. But
his brilliancy in the social circle and the fame of his marvellous
hoaxes had already spread far and wide, when an
unexpected event occurred which changed the whole tenor
of his life, and removed him from English society and from
English literature for nearly seven years.</p>

<p>Up to 1812, Theodore Hook had been almost, if not
entirely, dependent upon his pen for pecuniary supplies; his
father was in no condition to assist him; and at the rate of
two or three farces a year, which seems to have been about
the average of his productions, an income could scarcely
have been realized by any means commensurate with the
expenses of a fashionable young gentleman "upon town;"
debts began to accumulate, and he had already resorted to
the pernicious expedient of raising money upon his
"promise to write," (a draught upon the brain, honoured, on
at least one occasion, by Mr. Harris, the manager of Covent
Garden,) when he was presented with an appointment which
promised to place him in easy circumstances for the remainder
of his life&mdash;that of Accountant-General and
Treasurer at the Mauritius, worth about £2,000 per annum.
It was not, however, till October, 1813, that after a long
but agreeable voyage he entered upon his duties at the
Mauritius.</p>

<p>It so happened that the island, which had been captured
from the French in 1811, had been since that time under the
control of Mr. (afterwards Sir R. J.) Farquhar, who, as
Governor, united in his own person all the executive and
legislative powers. Nothing could have been more favourable
to the young official than this circumstance, Mr.
Farquhar being not only esteemed throughout the colony,
on account of his judgment, moderation, and affability, but
being also connected with Dr. James Hook, by the latter's
marriage with his sister. The reception which met Theodore
on his arrival was as encouraging as could have been wished,
and his own convivial qualities and agreeable manners soon<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span>
made him as popular among the <em>élite</em> of Port Louis as he
had been in the fashionable and literary circles of London.
In a letter addressed to his old friend, Mathews, about a
couple of years after his establishment in what he terms
"this paradise, and not without angels," he gives a most
spirited and joyous account of his general mode of life, and
of the social resources of the island:&mdash;</p>

<p>"We have," says he, "operas in the winter, which sets
in about July; and the races, too, begin in July. We have
an excellent beef-steak club, and the best Freemasons' lodge
in the world. We have subscription concerts and balls, and
the parties in private houses here are seldom less than from
two to three hundred. At the last ball given at the Government
House, upwards of seven hundred and fifty ladies were
present, which, considering that the greater proportion of
the female population are not admissible, proves the number
of inhabitants, and the extent of the society."</p>

<p>It may be supposed, that if he was delighted with the
Mauritius, its society was enchanted with him. He was but
twenty-five when he arrived; and the sudden advancement
of his position and enlargement of his resources, must have
had rather an exciting than a sobering influence on such a
temperament as his at that buoyant age. He was of course the
life and soul of the hospitalities of the place and all its amusements
and diversions&mdash;the phœnix of his <em>Thule</em>. He became,
among other things, a leading man on the <em>turf</em>, and repeatedly
mentions himself as having been extremely successful in the
pecuniary results of that dangerous pursuit. His own hospitality
was most liberal; many an Indian veteran yet delights to
recall the cordial welcome he found at <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">La Reduite</i> during a
brief sojourn at the Mauritius; and not a few such persons were
unconsciously sitting for their pictures in crayon then, and
in pen and ink afterwards, while they displayed their
Oriental airs before the juvenile Treasurer, their profuse
Amphitryon. His journal would make it easy enough to
identify not a few of the <em>Quihis</em> in his "Sayings and Doings,"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span>
and other novels of later life&mdash;but perhaps their spectres still
haunt the long walk at Cheltenham&mdash;<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">requiescant</i>!</p>

<p>Towards the end of 1817, General Farquhar found it
necessary, from the state of his health, to repair for a time
to England, and Major-General Gage John Hall was sworn
in as deputy-governor during his absence. On this occasion
the Governor appointed a commission consisting of five of
the principal men in the colony, to examine the accounts and
contents of the Treasury, in order that the finance department
might be handed over to his successor in a condition of
ascertained correctness. The commissioners signed a report
that they had examined the whole accordingly, and that books
and chest were all in the proper state. Their report was
dated November 19th, and Sir R. Farquhar sailed.</p>

<p>On the 15th of January, 1818, Lieutenant-Governor Hall
received a letter from William Allan, a clerk in the Treasury-office,
announcing to him, that, notwithstanding the above
report, a grave error existed, and had been passed over in
the Treasurer's accounts. No credit had been given for a
sum of 37,000 dollars, which sum he, Allan, knew to have
been paid in at the Treasury some fifteen months before.</p>

<p>General Hall instantly communicated this information to
Mr. Hook, and appointed another commission to re-examine
the condition of the public chest and accounts. The commission
began their work on the 11th of February: Allan
was examined <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">vivâ-voce</i> before them on that and on several
successive days. He addressed, while his examination was
in progress, letters upon letters to the deputy-governor and
also to the commissioners, in which he reiterated his assertions
that a large deficiency existed, that its existence had
been known to himself during many succeeding quarters, and
that he had so long concealed it from reluctance to bring
himself into collision with his superior, the Treasurer. His
letters, from the first very strangely written, became wilder
at every step; and on the morning of the 27th, before the
commissioners met, he shot himself. His last letter alleged<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span>
that he had been tampered with by Hook, who offered to
pay him thenceforth an allowance of twenty-five dollars per
month if he would instantly make his escape from the
Mauritius, and never re-appear there; but the person whom
he named as having brought Hook's message instantly contradicted
the statement <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">in toto</i> on oath before the commissioners.
There were many other witnesses; and the result
was the detection of not a few irregularities, omissions, and
discrepancies in the books of the Treasury.</p>

<p>The inquiry proceeded till the 9th of March; at eleven
that night Hook was arrested at a friend's house, where he
was supping, and dragged, by torchlight, through crowded
streets to the common prison. The town having shortly
before been the scene of a terrible conflagration, the prison
had been almost entirely destroyed. There was only one
cell in which the Treasurer could be placed, and that was in
so wretched a condition that at three in the morning he was
admitted to bail, escorted to the house of his bail-man, and
left there under his surveillance by the police. After a few
days he was handed over to the care of a millitary detachment,
and embarked with them for England as a culprit, to
be tried for <em>crimes</em>. Before he sailed, his property in the
island was disposed of, and the whole amount placed to
the public credit in the Treasury. Even the minutest articles
belonging to him were seized. After he was on board ship,
a negro slave came alongside to beg his acceptance of his
writing-desk, which the poor fellow had bought at the auction
for ten shillings.</p>

<p>He had a protracted and most unhappy voyage of nine
months. For one whole month they were tossed in a hurricane
off the Cape of Good Hope, and for six weeks
reduced to the allowance of half a pound of mouldy buiscuit
and half a pint of water by the day. While refitting at the
Cape, however, Hook, who had by that time conciliated the
regard of his keepers by his unshaken fortitude and good-humoured
submission, was made their companion on shore,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span>
on <em>parole</em>; and how completely he could, under such calamitous
circumstances, exert his faculties of observation, we
may judge from the most picturesque sketches of the Cape,
the capital, and its inhabitants, which occur in one of his
subsequent stories&mdash;<cite>Maxwell</cite>. The ship also stopped for a
day or two at St. Helena; and by the kindness of the officers,
Hook accompanied them when they went to Longwood to be
presented to Napoleon.</p>

<p>The ship reached Portsmouth in January, 1819, and the
warrant of arrest and other documents were transmitted to
London, and referred to the law officers. The Attorney-General
reported, that however irregular Mr. Hook's official
conduct might have been, and however justly he might
be prosecuted for a civil debt, there was no apparent ground
for a criminal procedure. He was therefore liberated; and
reaching London with <em>two gold mohurs</em> in his pocket, was
immediately subjected to the scrutiny of the Audit Board&mdash;a
scrutiny which did not terminate until after the lapse of
nearly five years.</p>

<p>During this long suspense, eternal commissions and cross-examinations
before the auditors of public accounts, and a
very voluminous series of correspondence with them and
others on the subject of the defalcation, had not occupied the
whole of Hook's attention. If they had, he must have
starved; for though his successor was not appointed till late
in the inquiry, he never received a farthing in his official
capacity, from the time of his original arrest.</p>

<p>By the end of 1819, Hook had established himself in a
very humble cottage at Somers Town, where his household
consisted of a single maid-servant; and formed connections
with newspapers or magazines, which supplied the small
necessities of the passing day. He seems at first to have
felt his position far too painfully to think of reclaiming any
but a few of his older and, comparatively speaking, humble
allies&mdash;such as Mathews, Terry, and good little Hill; the
last of whom had encountered sad reverses during his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span>
absence, and was now, perhaps, except himself, the poorest
of the set. On their kindness he might rely implicitly&mdash;as
well as upon the cordial friendship and sound professional
advice of Messrs. Powell and Broderip.</p>

<p>It was shortly after his location at Somers Town that
Hook renewed his acquaintance with Mr. Wilson Croker, in
whose society no small portion of his time was spent, both
at the Admiralty and at the latter's villa at Molesey. He
was also occasionally a visitor at General Phipps's (a relation
of his mother's), in Harley-street, where he met and speedily
became intimate with the late Speaker, Lord Canterbury.
They were afterwards seen a great deal together, and the
pair strolling arm-in-arm down St. James's-street, forms the
subject of one&mdash;not the most happy&mdash;of the HB sketches.<a name="FNanchor_6" id="FNanchor_6"></a><a href="#Footnote_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a>
With these exceptions, for a long period his position as a
public defaulter, together with the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">res angustæ domi</i>, confined
him to the narrow and comparatively inexpensive circle of
his old literary and theatrical associates.</p>

<p>During the summer of 1820, Theodore Hook opened his
campaign against the Queen by a thin octavo, which at the
time made considerable noise. It was entitled "Tentamen;
or an Essay towards the History of Whittington and his
Cat," by Dr. Vicesimus Blenkinsop. The Whittington, of
course, was no other than Alderman Wood, and Caroline was
the cat. "Throughout the whole <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">libellus</i>," says Lockhart,
"there was a prodigious rattle of puns and conundrums&mdash;but
the strong points of the case against Whittington and
Co. were skilfully brought out, nevertheless. Hook being
as yet quite <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">in obscuro</i>, nobody suspected him. It was
pretty generally ascribed to the manufacturers of the 'New
Whig Guide.'"</p>

<p>"Tentamen" was followed by several similar pamphlets,
chiefly in verse, all directed against Alderman Wood and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span>the other supporters of the Queen, and all published in the
same year (1820) by Wright, of Fleet-street. They are also
to be distinguished by a caricature likeness of the celebrated
Alderman, the same portrait appearing on the title-page both
of "Tentamen" and the others. One of these we recollect is
entitled <cite>Solomon Logwood</cite>.<a name="FNanchor_7" id="FNanchor_7"></a><a href="#Footnote_7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a></p>

<p>In the spring of this year (1820), Hook, with the assistance
of his old friend, Daniel Terry, started a small periodical.
It was published, and we believe suggested, by Mr. Miller,
who had recently engaged extensive premises in&mdash;what was
then expected to prove a great mart for the lighter description
of literature&mdash;a sort of occidental "Row,"&mdash;the Burlington
Arcade. Hence the name of the first-born, "The Arcadian,"
but which, to say the truth, had little of the pastoral in its
composition, if we except a certain long ballad of melodious
rhythm and provoking pungency, addressed to Lady Holland,
and commencing,&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<p class="verseq">"Listen, lady, to my measures,</p>
<p class="verse4">While they softly, gently flow,</p>
<p class="verse">While I sing the harmless pleasures</p>
<p class="verse4">Of the classic, silver Po," etc.</p>
</div></div></div>

<p class="noindent">The war-cry of "The Arcadian" was of course "King and
Constitution," for its editor was Conservative, or rather
Tory (the former euphuism was not then in vogue) to the
heart's core. Much, too, of that personality was introduced
in its pages, which rendered its more fortunate successor,
the <cite>John Bull</cite>, so formidable. The same contemptuous tone,
in treating of theatricals, is observable both in the <cite>John Bull</cite>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span>and its tiny predecessor. "The Arcadian" contains a most
exquisite critique, a perfect masterpiece of irony, upon the
"first appearance" of a certain young lady, and some caustic
remarks on the stage and its attractions, curious as coming
from a popular dramatist, writing in the thirty-second year
of his age.</p>

<p>Full of fun and spirit as the little magazine was, it nevertheless
came to an untimely end: only two numbers ever
made their appearance. Such was the difficulty which the
publisher experienced in making up the second, owing to
Hook's listlessness, or more probably preoccupation, that he
declined venturing on a third.</p>

<p>This was the prelude of <cite>John Bull</cite>. The most important
event with which the name of Theodore Hook stands connected,
is unquestionably the establishment of the <cite>John Bull</cite>
newspaper, at the close of 1820. The universal, instantaneous,
and appreciable effect produced on the great political
movements of the day by its appearance, is perhaps unparalleled
in the history of periodical literature.</p>

<p>The Queen's affair had gone on all the summer and
autumn; the madness of popular exacerbation gaining new
intenseness with every week that passed. None who remember
the feelings and aspects of the time will think it
possible to exaggerate either in description: but we shall
make no such attempt. The explosion scattered brilliant
terror far and wide. No first appearance of any periodical
work of any class whatever has, in our time at least, produced
such a startling sensation&mdash;it told at once from the convulsed
centre to every extremity of the kingdom. There was talent
of every sort, apparently, that could have been desired or
devised for such a purpose. It seemed as if a legion of
sarcastic devils had brooded in synod over the elements of
withering derision. But, as far as Hook's MSS. allowed
his biographers to judge, he was really and truly alone; and,
at all events, they exonerate most completely certain other
persons who were at first saddled with a large share of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span>
merit and the obloquy of the <cite>Bull</cite>. Of the famous songs
during the winter of 1820-21, only one, he used to say, was
an extraneous contribution.</p>

<p>The paper set out with one specific object: the extinction
of the Brandenburgh House party; and, to accomplish this,
Hook's varied talents&mdash;his wit and humour, his sarcasm and
bitterness, his keenness of argument, fiery zeal, and unscrupulous
daring&mdash;were all brought to bear with concentrated
energy upon the ranks of the Opposition. Any man reckless
of legal consequences, or beyond their reach, familiar with
the current scandal of the day, and having so powerful an
engine as a public paper at his disposal, may inflict a vast
amount of injury upon his adversaries; but to these conditions,
in the present case, may be added powers, if not of
the very highest order, doubtless the best adapted to the
purpose, sources of information peculiar and inexplicable, a
singleness of purpose, and firm conviction of its justice, that
combined to render <cite>Bull</cite> the most formidable antagonist
that had as yet entered the lists against the Queen.</p>

<p>Many of <cite>Bull's</cite> songs, in construction, and even in execution,
were very little different from those which Hook used
to improvise in the course of a festive evening. It has been
said by one who knew him, that a person who never witnessed
that marvellous performance could not take a better notion of
what it was than from such a piece as the "Visit of Mrs.
Muggins," in thirty-one stanzas.</p>

<p>Here also Hook commenced and continued from time to
time, for ten years, that famous series of Ramsbottom Papers,
which were the precursors of all the Mrs. Malaprops, Mrs.
Partingtons, and Mrs. Browns of a later generation, and
which, like nearly all originals, greatly surpassed in genuine
humour and excellence the cleverest imitations that have
since appeared.</p>

<p>By his flagellations of the Whigs, meantime, Hook had
shut against himself the gates of forbearance at Whitehall.
He might have thought himself well off, if he had not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span>
tempted harshness into play against him. He thought he
had: he always persisted that the auditor's final report on
him was an unjust deliverance; and he maintained equally
the opinion that the measures of the Government consequent
on that report were unusually severe. The award was at
last given in the autumn of 1823, and it pronounced him a
debtor to the Crown of over £12,000.</p>

<p>On his arrest under the Exchequer writ (August, 1823),
he was taken to the dwelling and spunging-house of the
sheriff's officer, his captor, by name Mr. Hemp, and still
hoping that a protracted imprisonment was not seriously
intended, he chose to remain there week after week, and
month after month, until Easter. The expense of board
and lodging at a house of that class is always heavy; his
accommodations were mean, and the situation about the
worst in London&mdash;Shire Lane, so named as separating part
of the City from Middlesex&mdash;a vile, squalid place, noisy
and noxious, apparently almost inaccessible either to air or
light, swarming with a population of thief-catchers, gin-sellers,
and worse. But his spirit was not yet to be broken.
He endured the unwholesome confinement with patience&mdash;no
sooner was hope knocked down in one quarter than it
sprung up again in another&mdash;he kept himself steadily at
work in the mornings, and his few intimates commonly
gathered round him in the evening.</p>

<p>In April, 1824, Hook at last took his leave of Shire Lane.
He had, as usual, made himself a great favourite with Hemp
and his family, and such a guest could not be allowed to
depart without a farewell banquet. The company exhibited
in harmonious contrast Mr. Hook's theatrical and literary
confidants of the time, and sundry distinguished ornaments
of his hospitable landlord's own order. The sederunt did
not close without a specimen of the improvisatore; and his
ballad "showed up" Mr. Hemp and his brethren, as intrusted
with the final offices of the law in the case of the
grand culprit before them:&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span></p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<p class="center smcap">Chorus&mdash;</p>
<p class="verse">"Let him hang with a curse,&mdash;this atrocious, pernicious</p>
<p class="verse">Scoundrel that emptied the till at Mauritius!"<a name="FNanchor_8" id="FNanchor_8"></a><a href="#Footnote_8" class="fnanchor">[8]</a></p>
</div></div></div>

<p>The close confinement in the bad air of Shire Lane had
affected his health, and indeed his personal appearance was
permanently damaged in consequence of the total disuse of
exercise for so many months, and the worry of mind which
even he must have been enduring. He came out pale and
flabby in the face, and with a figure fast tending to corpulence.
He was transferred to the Rules of the King's<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span>
Bench, within which he hired a small separate lodging, in
an airy enough situation&mdash;Temple Place.</p>

<p>In 1824 Theodore Hook published the first series of that
collection of tales which, under the title of "Sayings and
Doings,"<a name="FNanchor_9" id="FNanchor_9"></a><a href="#Footnote_9" class="fnanchor">[9]</a> placed him at once in the highest rank of the
novelists of his generation; above all his contemporaries,
with the one exception, of course, of the Author of
"Waverley." The first idea and plan of the work was
struck out during the sitting of a sort of <cite>John Bull</cite> conclave
held at Fulham, and had origin in the suggestion of
a friend, who, delighted with the anecdotes of Colonial life
which Hook was pouring forth, conceived that they might
be turned to better account than the mere entertainment of
a dinner-party, and hit upon a title, at which Hook caught
with <ins class="corr" title="Transcriber's Note&mdash;Original text: 'eagnerness'">eagerness</ins>. So convinced was the latter that his first
tale, "The Man of Sorrow," had not been fairly appreciated,
that he actually embodied in his new essay the rejected
attempt of Mr. Alfred Allendale, condensed, indeed, and
purged from its impurities, but not materially altered from
the original. Much better in every respect is the story of
"Danvers, the <cite>Parvenu</cite>."</p>

<p>The more prominent characters in Hook's novels are, in
spite of his disclaimer, unquestionably portraits. To many
of the Anglo-Indian sketches, the journal kept during the
author's sojourn at the Mauritius would doubtless supply a
key.</p>

<p>Hook, indeed, always denied the possession of inventive
faculties. There was doubtless truth as well as modesty in
his assertion: "Give me a story to tell, and I can tell it,
but I cannot create."</p>

<p>The popularity of the first series of "Sayings and Doings"
(three vols.) may be estimated from his diary, which records
the profit to the author as £2,000. There were, we believe,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span>
three considerable impressions before the Second Series,
also in three vols., was ready in the spring of 1825. And
shortly after that publication he was at length released from
custody&mdash;with an intimation, however, that the Crown
abandoned nothing of its claim for the Mauritius debt.</p>

<p>The first series of "Sayings and Doings" were soon
followed (1825-1829) by a second and third, which are
generally considered in every way superior to the former
ones. The author was of this opinion himself, and the
public as certainly ratified his verdict.</p>

<p>In the meantime Theodore Hook, released from his temporary
confinement, had taken a cottage at Putney, of which
neighbourhood he had always been fond, and may be said
to have re-entered society, though his circle of acquaintance
continued limited for a couple of years more.</p>

<p>While at Putney, in 1826, he from motives of pure kindness
re-wrote, that is to say, composed from rough illiterate
materials, the very entertaining "Reminiscences" of an old
theatrical and musical friend of his&mdash;Michael Kelly. The
book was received with astonishment, for he generously kept
his own secret.</p>

<p>In 1827 he took a higher flight, and became the tenant
of a house in Cleveland Row&mdash;on the edge of what, in one
of his novels, he describes as "the real London&mdash;the space
between Pall Mall on the south, and Piccadilly on the north,
St. James's-street on the west, and the Opera House to the
east." The residence was handsome, and indeed appeared
extravagantly too large for his purpose. He was admitted a
member of several clubs; became the first attraction of their
house-dinners; and in those where play was allowed, might
usually be seen in the course of his protracted evening.
Soon he began to receive invitations to great houses in the
country, and from week after week, often travelled from one
to another, to all outward appearance, in the style of an
idler of high condition. He had soon entangled himself
with habits and connections which implied considerable<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span>
curtailment of his labour at the desk, and entailed a course
of expenditure more than sufficient to swallow all the profits
of what remained.</p>

<p>His next novel, "Maxwell," published in 1830, is, in point
of plot, by far the most perfect of his productions; the
interest which is at once excited, never for an instant flags,
and the mystery, so far from being of the flimsy transparent
texture, common to romances, is such as to baffle the most
practised and quick-witted discoverer of <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">dénoûments</i>, and to
defy all attempts at elucidation.</p>

<p>New debts began to accumulate on him so rapidly, that
about 1831, he found it necessary to get rid of the house at
St. James's, and to remove to one of more modest dimensions
close to Fulham Bridge, with a small garden looking
towards the river. Here in the locality which had long
been a favourite one with him, he remained till his death;
but though he took advantage of the change to drop the
custom of giving regular dinners, and probably to strike off
some other sources of expense, he not only continued his
habits of visiting, but extended them as new temptations
offered.</p>

<p>Probably few of his admirers ever knew exactly where
Hook lived. His letters and cards were left for him at one
or other of his clubs, but it is doubtful if the interior of his
Fulham cottage was ever seen by half a dozen people besides
his old intimate friends and familiars. To the upper world
he was visible only as the jocund convivialist of the club&mdash;the
brilliant wit of the lordly banquet, the lion of the
crowded assembly, the star of a Christmas or Easter party
in a rural palace, the unfailing stage-manager, prompter,
author, and occasionally excellent comic actor of private
theatricals.</p>

<p>But, notwithstanding the round of gaiety and pleasure in
which the greater number of his evenings were spent, the
time so employed cannot be said to have been altogether
wasted; for, to a writer who has to draw from life, whose<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span>
books are men and women, and to whom the gossip and
<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">on dits</i> of the day are the rough material of his manufacture,
a constant mixing in society of every accessible rank is
absolutely necessary&mdash;to one of his taste and discrimination,
the higher the grade the better. Whithersoever he went he
carried with him not only an unfailing fund of entertainment,
but also unslumbering powers of observation, that
served to redeem what otherwise would have appeared mere
weakness and self-indulgence. And that he was not slow
to avail himself of the advantages that fell to his share, no
one will deny, who casts a glance over the list of productions
he gave to the world, during a period when the intellectual
exertion of his convivial hours alone would have
exhausted the energies, physical and mental, of well-nigh
any other man.</p>

<p>In 1832 he published the "Life of Sir David Baird," a
standard biographical work, and one spoken of in the highest
terms by the best reviews of the day. So satisfied were the
family with the manner in which he executed his task, that
they presented him with a magnificent gold snuff-box set
with brilliants, the gift of the Pasha of Egypt to the subject
of the memoir. Hook seems to have tossed the trinket
aside as an unconsidered trifle into a drawer, from which it
was happily rescued on the accidental discovery of its value
and importance.</p>

<p>In 1833 he sent forth no fewer than six volumes, full of
originality and wit; a novel called the "Parson's Daughter,"
and a couple of stories under the title of "Love and Pride."
In one of the latter, the supposed resemblance of Liston to a
certain noble lord is happily turned to account; the being
mistaken for <em>Mr. Buggins</em>, principal low comedian of the
Theatre Royal, Drury Lane, forming a light and pointed
climax to the <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">congeries</i> of ridiculous miseries heaped on the
unfortunate Marquis.</p>

<p>In 1836, Theodore Hook undertook the editorship of the
<cite>New Monthly Magazine</cite>, at a salary of four hundred<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span>
pounds a year, irrespective of the sums to be paid for
original contributions. Here he commenced his "Gilbert
Gurney," accommodating himself to the exceedingly uncomfortable
practice, now all but universal among popular
and prolific novelists, of delivering his tale by monthly
instalments. To this plan, though obliged to succumb to it,
he always took exception, as not only wearisome to the
reader, but fatal to fair development of plot.</p>

<p>Of all his works, "Gilbert Gurney" is by far the most
mirth-provoking and remarkable. His own adventures form
the groundwork of the comedy; himself and his friends
figure as the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">dramatis personæ</i>, and throughout the whole
there appear an unrestrained expression of private feelings,
and a frequency of personal allusion, that give it the semblance
and almost the interest of true history.</p>

<p>In his next novel, "Jack Brag," Hook again hit upon
a character with which he could go to work <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">con amore</i>.
Vulgar, vain, and impudent, a cross between a tallow-chandler,
and what, in the cant phrase of the day, is termed
a sporting <em>gent</em>, a hanger-on upon the loose branches of the
aristocracy, and occasionally thrown into society more
respectable, Mr. Brag's <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">gaucheries</i> convulse the reader;
while those who scorn not to read a warning, even on the
page of a novel, may be led to devote more than a passing
thought to the folly (to say the least of it) of indulging in
the very silly and very common habit of perpetual though
petty misrepresentation, as regards their means and position
in life, and the nature and degree of their acquaintance with
individuals of a rank higher than their own. There is no
lower depth of drawing-room degradation than is involved
in the exposure of one of these pretenders; unrecognised,
perhaps, by his "most intimate friend" Lord A&mdash;&mdash;, cut by
his "old crony" Sir John B&mdash;&mdash;, or never "heard of" by
his "college chum," the Bishop of C&mdash;&mdash;.</p>

<p>"Jack Brag" was followed, in 1839, by "Births, Marriages,
and Deaths," which, notwithstanding its infelicitous<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span>
title,&mdash;as far as fitness goes, it might as well have been called
"Law Notices," or "Fashionable Intelligence," or by any
other newspaper "heading,"&mdash;was a novel of a higher class
than any he had before attempted: the humour is scantier and
more subdued than heretofore, and though the magnificent
<em>Colonel Magnus</em>, and his rascally attorney <em>Brassey</em>, here and
there afford admirable sport, the latter, with his economical
wardrobe, to wit:&mdash;"one tooth-brush twisted up in a piece
of whitey-brown paper; a razor by itself tied with a piece
of red tape to a round pewter shaving-box (enclosing a
bit of soap), with the tip of its handle peeping from the
bottom of a leathern case, like the feet of a long-legged
Lilliputian sticking out of his coffin; a remarkably dirty
flannel under-waistcoat, edged with light blue silk and silver;
one pair of black silk socks, brown in the bottoms," &amp;c.&mdash;yet
the general effect is heavy,&mdash;heavier, that is, than the
public were inclined to accept from the pen of Theodore
Hook.</p>

<p>This, in point of fact, may be considered his last finished
work. "Precepts and Practice" appeared in 1840,&mdash;the
name an obvious plagiarism, and from himself, being merely
a collection of short papers and tales, published during the
preceding year or two, in the <cite>New Monthly</cite>, of which he
was the editor. As for "Fathers and Sons," portions of
which appeared in the same magazine, and "Peregrine
Bunce," we believe neither of them to have been completed
by his own hand; of the latter, about one hundred pages of
the last of the three volumes were certainly supplied by
another writer.</p>

<p>The production of thirty-eight volumes, within sixteen
years, Hook being all the while editor, and almost sole
writer, of a newspaper, affords sufficient proof that he never
sank into idleness; but in other respects there had been
great changes within that period. Two unhappy errors into
which he had fallen marred the happiness of the remainder<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span>
of his life. Before his arrest in 1823, he had formed a
<em>liaison</em>, which, though perhaps excusable in his position at
Somers Town, was persisted in afterwards under less adverse
circumstances, until the righteous consequences of guilt
could not be averted. This connection soon became such
as, in his position, and with the kind and manly feelings
which adhered to him, made it impossible for him to marry
in his proper condition; and though he often thought of
atoning to his partner, and in some sort to the children
she had borne him, by making her his wife, he never took
courage to satisfy his conscience by carrying that purpose into
effect. The second error regarded his debt to the Crown,
which, though during the last twenty years of life he was
in receipt of an affluent income from his writings, he made
no real or adequate effort to repay by instalments. Hook
never denied that he was in justice responsible for a deficit
of £9,000; and those who had the sole authority to judge of
the matter, pronounced the rightful claim to be £12,000.
When he was released from the King's Bench, he was told
distinctly that the debt must hang over him until every
farthing was paid. We know that he had, in his great and
various talents, left from that hour at his free command,
means of earning far more than enough for his own decent
maintenance, and that of his unfortunate family; and most
clearly every shilling that he could make beyond that ought
to have been, from time to time, paid into the Exchequer
towards the liquidation of his debt. In neglecting this,
he threw away the only chance before him of effectually
vindicating his character, together with all reasonable
chance of ever again profiting by the open patronage of either
the Crown or its Ministers. In every page of his works we
trace the disastrous influence of both these grand original
errors, perpetually crossing and blackening the picture of
superficial gaiety&mdash;indications, not to be mistaken, of a conscience
ill at ease; of painful recollections and dark antici<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span>pations
rising irrepressibly, and not to be stifled; of good,
gentle, and generous feelings converted by the stings of
remorse into elements of torture.</p>

<p>His pecuniary embarrassments became deeper and darker
every year. Even in the midst of his abundant dissipation
he worked hard in the mornings&mdash;certainly he covered with
his MS. more paper than would have proved, in almost any
other man's case, the energetic exertion of every hour in
every day that passed over his head; and little did his fine
friends understand or reflect at what an expense of tear and
wear he was devoting his evenings to their amusement.</p>

<p>About a month before his decease he wrote to Mr. Barham,
whom he requested to run down to Fulham and see him, as
he was too ill to leave home himself; and of the interview
which ensued we are enabled to give a somewhat full account,
committed to paper shortly afterwards, and evidently with
the view of fixing the impression, yet fresh, in the writer's
mind:&mdash;</p>

<p>"It was on the 29th of July, 1841, that I last saw poor
Hook. I had received a note from him requesting me to
come down and see him, as he wished much to talk over
some matters of importance, and could not, from the state of
his health, drive into town. I went accordingly, and after a
long conversation, which related principally to * * * and to
his novel, 'Peregrine Bunce,' then going through the press,
but which he never lived to complete, a roast fowl was put
on the table for luncheon. He helped me and took a piece
himself, but laid down his knife and fork after the first
mouthful, which, indeed, he made an unsuccessful attempt to
swallow. On my observing his unusual want of appetite&mdash;for
his luncheon was in general his dinner&mdash;he said: 'It is of
no use, old fellow; the fact is I have not tasted a morsel of
solid food these five days!' 'Then what on earth have you
lived upon?' to which he replied, 'Effervescing draughts;'
adding afterwards, that he was allowed to take occasionally a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span>tumbler of rum and milk, or a pint of Guinness's bottled
porter.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/i_036fp.jpg" alt="" />
<div class="caption">At the age of 51 from a Portrait by Count D'Orsay</div>
</div>

<p>"On hearing this, I strongly pressed on him the necessity
of having further advice, which he at length promised he
would do, if he were not better in a day or two. I told him
that my wife and myself were going down to the Isle of
Thanet, and pressed him very much to throw work overboard
for a while, and accompany us and be nursed. He said,
however, 'he was completely tied to his desk till he had
concluded what he was then writing for Colburn and Bentley;
but that he should get quite clear of his trammels in about a
month, and then, if we were still there, he would make an
effort to pay us a visit.'"</p>

<p>In truth, he was soon past writing; death was advancing
upon him with rapid strides, while earthly prospects were
growing, daily, darker and more threatening. It is painful
to reflect that his last hours, ere the struggling mind had
sunk into insensibility, were disturbed by the apprehension of
inability to meet a couple of bills of comparatively trifling
amount, on the point, as he believed, of becoming due. On
Friday, the 13th of August, he took finally to his bed, the
stream hurried on with increasing velocity as it approached
the fall&mdash;a brief agitated interval, happily not neglected, was
left for the first, last work of erring man, and on the evening
of the 24th he expired.</p>

<p>The disorder under which he had been labouring for years,
arose from a diseased state of the liver and stomach, brought
on partly by mental anxiety, but principally, it is to be
feared, by that habit of over-indulgence at table, the curse of
Colonial life, which he had early acquired, and to which he
held with fatal perseverance to the end. It needed no
ordinary powers to enable him to sustain the contest so long;
but his frame was robust and his constitution vigorous; and
he seems to have possessed in a remarkable degree that
power of maintaining the supremacy of mind over matter,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span>
which rendered him indifferent to, or unconscious of, the first
slow approaches of decay. He was buried with extreme
privacy at Fulham; a simple stone bearing his name and age
marks the spot, which is immediately opposite the chancel
window, and within a few paces of his former home.</p>

MRS. RAMSBOTTOM'S PARTY.</h3>

<p class="right small">April, 1822.</p>

<p class="drop-capx">On Thursday last, Mrs. Ramsbottom, of Pudding-lane,
opened her house to a numerous party of her friends.
The drawing-room over the compting-house, and the small
closet upon the stairs, were illuminated in a most tasteful
manner, and Mr. Ramsbottom's own room was appropriated
to card-tables, where all-fours and cribbage were the order of
the night. Several pounds were won and lost.</p>

<p>The shop was handsomely fitted up for quadrilles, which
began as soon as it was dark; the rooms being lighted with
an abundance of patent lamps, and decorated with artificial
flowers. The first quadrille was danced by&mdash;</p>

<p>At half-past ten the supper-room was thrown open, and
presented to the admiring eyes of the company a most<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span>
elegant and substantial hot repast. The mackerel and fennel-sauce
were particularly noticed, as were the boiled legs of
lamb and spinach; and we cannot sufficiently praise the
celerity with which the ham and sausages were removed, as
the respectable families of the Jewish persuasion entered the
room. The port and sherry were of the first quality.
Supper lasted till about a quarter past two, when dancing
was resumed, and continued till Sol warned the festive party
to disperse.</p>

<p>The dresses of the company were remarkably elegant.
Mrs. Ramsbottom was simply attired in a pea-green satin
dress, looped up with crimson cord and tassels, with a bright
yellow silk turban and hair to match; a magnificent French
watch, chain, and seals were suspended from her left side,
and her neck was adorned with a very elegant row of full-sized
sky-blue beads, pendant to which was a handsome
miniature of Mr. Ramsbottom, in the costume of a corporal
in the Limehouse Volunteers, of which corps he was justly
considered the brightest ornament.</p>

<p>The Misses Ramsbottom were dressed alike, in sky-blue
dresses, trimmed with white bugles, blue bead necklaces, and
ear-rings <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">en suite</i>. We never saw a more pleasing exhibition
of female beauty, the sylph-like forms of the three youngest,
contrasted with the high-conditioned elegance of the two
eldest, formed a pleasing variety; while the uniform appearance
of the family red hair, set off by the cerulean glow of
the drapery, gave a sympathetic sameness to the group,
which could not fail to be interesting to the admirers of
domestic happiness.</p>

<p>The Misses Solomons attracted particular notice, as did the
fascinating Miss Louisa Doddell, and the lovely Miss Hogsflesh,
delighted the company after supper with the plaintive
air of "Nobody coming to marry me;" Mr. Stubbs and Mr.
J. Stubbs sang "All's well" with great effect, and Mr.
Doddell and his accomplished sister were rapturously encored
in the duet of "Oh Nanny, wilt thou gang wi' me?"</p>

MISS LAVINIA RAMSBOTTOM.</h3>

<p class="right small">April 27, 1823.</p>

<p>The following is from no less a personage than our fair
favourite, Miss Lavinia Ramsbottom:&mdash;</p>

<p>"Ma' desires me to write to you, to say that you are quite out<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span>
in your reckoning as to dry-salters and citizens going to the
Opera in hackney-coaches, and she hopes you will correct your
calumny about our being in the straw. A friend of Pa's, who
lives in the Minories, who is a great friend of Mr. Broom's, the
Queen's lawyer, says that you are very malicious, and that,
after all your pretended kindness last year, in putting in Ma's
account of our party <em>gratis</em> for nothing, you only did it to
quiz us; and Ma' says she shall continue to go to the Opera
as long as she pleases, and she does not care whether the
people have any clothes on, or none, so long as her betters
countenances it.</p>

<p>"P.S.&mdash;Pa's young men play at Cardinal Puff, with table-beer,
after supper every night,&mdash;so you see we have got <em>that</em>
from the West End."</p>

MISS LAVINIA'S LETTER FROM PARIS, FORWARDING
HER MOTHER'S JOURNAL IN ENGLAND
AND FRANCE.</h3>

<p class="center smcap">To John Bull.</p>

<p class="right small">Paris, Dec. 10, 1823.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">My dear Mr. B.</span>,&mdash;The kindness with which you put in
the account of our party last year, induces my Mamma to
desire me to write to you again, to know if you would like
to insert a journal of her travels.</p>

<p>My Papa has retired from business; he has left the shop
in the Minories, and has taken a house in Montague Place&mdash;a
beautiful street very far west, and near the British Museum&mdash;and
my two younger sisters have been sent over here, to
improve their education and their morals, and Mamma and I
came over last week to see them, and if they had got polish
enough, to take them home again. Papa would not come<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span>
with us, because, when he was quite a youth, he got a very
great alarm in Chelsea Reach, because the waterman would
put up a sail, and from that time to this he never can be prevailed
upon to go to sea; so we came over under the care of
Mr. Fulmer, the banker's son, who was coming to his family.</p>

<p>Mamma has not devoted much of her time to the study of
English, and does not understand French at all, and therefore
perhaps her journal will here and there appear incorrect, but
she is a great etymologist, and so fond of you, that although I
believe Mr. Murray, the great bookseller in Albemarle Street,
would give her, I do not know how many thousand pounds
for her book, if she published it "all in the lump," as Papa
says, she prefers sending it to you piecemeal, and so you will
have it every now and then, as a portion of it is done. I
have seen Mr. Fulmer laugh sometimes when she has been
reading it; but I see nothing to laugh at, except the hard
words she uses, and the pains she takes to find out meanings
for things. She says if you do not like to print it, you may
let Murray have it&mdash;but that, of course, she would prefer
your doing it.</p>

<p>I enclose a portion&mdash;more shall come soon. Papa, I believe,
means to ask you to dinner when we get back to town; he
says you are a terrible body, and as he has two or three weak
points in his character, he thinks it better to be friends with
you than foes. I know of but one fault he has&mdash;yes, perhaps
two&mdash;but I will not tell you what they are till I see whether
you publish Mamma's journal.</p>

<p>Adieu! I was very angry with you for praising little Miss
M. at the Lord Mayor's Dinner; I know her only by sight:
we are not quite in those circles yet, but I think when we
get into Montague Place we may see something of life. She
is a very pretty girl, and very amiable, and that is the truth
of it, but you had no business to say so, you fickle monster.</p>

<p class="right padr6">Yours truly,</p>

<p class="right smcap wsp">Lavinia Higginbottom.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span></p>

<p>We proceeded, after reading this letter, to open the enclosure,
and found what follows. We do not presume to alter
one word, but when any trifling difficulty occurs, arising from
the <ins class="corr" title="Transcriber's Note&mdash;Original text: 'depth  f'">depth of</ins> Mrs. Higginbottom's research, we have ventured
to insert a note. The title of the manuscript is</p>

<p class="center p1 wsp">ENGLAND AND FRANCE,</p>

<p class="center smcap wsp">By Dorothea Julia Higginbottom.</p>

<p>And thus, gentle reader, it ran:&mdash;</p>

<p>"Having often heard travellers lament not having put
down what they call the memorybillious of their journies, I
was determined while I was on my tower, to keep a dairy
(so called from containing the cream of one's information),
and record everything which recurred to me&mdash;therefore I
begin with my departure from London.</p>

<p>"Resolving to take time by the firelock, we left Mountague
Place at seven o'clock by Mr. Fulmer's pocket thermometer,
and proceeded over Westminster-bridge to explode the European
continent.</p>

<p>"I never pass Whitehall without dropping a tear to the
memory of Charles the Second, who was decimated after the
rebellion of 1745 opposite the Horse-Guards&mdash;his memorable
speech to Archbishop Caxon rings in my ears whenever I
pass the spot&mdash;I reverted my head, and affected to look to
see what o'clock it was by the dial, on the opposite side of
the way.</p>

<p>"It is quite impossible not to notice the improvements in
this part of the town; the beautiful view which one gets of
Westminster Hall, and its curious roof, after which, as everybody
knows, its builder was called William Roofus.</p>

<p>"Amongst the lighter specimens of modern architecture,
is Ashley's Ampletheatre, on your right, as you cross the
bridge, (which was built, Mr. Fulmer told me, by the Court
of Arches and the House of Peers). In this ampletheatre<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span>
there are equestrian performances, so called because they are
exhibeted nightly&mdash;during the season.</p>

<p>"It is quite impossible to quit this 'mighty maze,' as Lady
Hopkins emphatically calls London, in her erudite 'Essay
upon Granite,' without feeling a thousand powerful sensations&mdash;so
much wealth, so much virtue, so much vice, such
business as is carried on, within its precincts, such influence
as its inhabitants possess in every part of the civilized world&mdash;it
really exalts the mind from meaner things, and casts all
minor considerations far behind one.</p>

<p>"The toll at the Marsh-gate is ris since we last come
through&mdash;it was here we were to have taken up Lavinia's
friend, Mr. Smith, who had promised to go with us to Dover,
but we found his servant instead of himself, with a billy, to
say he was sorry he could not come, because his friend, Sir
John somebody, wished him to stay and go down to Poll at
Lincoln. I have no doubt this Poll, whoever she may be, is
a very respectable young woman, but mentioning her, by her
Christian name only, in so abrupt a manner, had a very unpleasant
appearance at any rate.</p>

<p>"Nothing remarkable occurred till we reached the Obstacle
in St. George's Fields, where our attention was arrested by
those great institutions, the 'School for the Indignant
Blind,' and the 'Misanthropic Society' for making shoes,
both of which claim the gratitude of the nation.</p>

<p>"At the corner of the lane leading to Peckham, I saw that
they had removed the Dollygraph which used to stand up on
the declivity to the right of the road&mdash;the dollygraphs are all
to be superseded by Serampores.</p>

<p>"When we came to the Green Man at Blackheath we had
an opportunity of noticing the errors of former travellers, for
the heath is green, and the man is black; Mr. Fulmer
endeavoured to account for this, by saying that Mr. Colman
has discovered that Moors being black, and Heaths being a
kind of Moor, he looks upon the confusion of words as the
cause of the mistake.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span></p>

<p>"N.B. Colman is the eminent Itinerary Surgeon, who
constantly resides at St. Pancras.</p>

<p>"As we went near Woolwich we saw at a distance the
artillery officers on a common, a firing away with their bombs
in mortars like any thing.</p>

<p>"At Dartford they make gunpowder; here we changed
horses, at the inn we saw a most beautiful Rhoderick Random
in a pot, covered with flowers, it is the finest I ever saw,
except those at Dropmore. [Note (Rhododendron).]</p>

<p>"When we got to Rochester we went to the Crown Inn
and had a cold collection: the charge was absorbent&mdash;I had
often heard my poor dear husband talk of the influence of
the Crown, and a Bill of Wrights, but I had no idea what it
really meant till we had to pay one.</p>

<p>"As we passed near Chatham I saw several Pitts, and Mr.
Fulmer showed me a great many buildings&mdash;I believe he said
they were fortyfications, but I think there must have been
near fifty of them&mdash;he also shewed us the Lines at Chatham,
which I saw quite distinctly, with the clothes drying on them.
Rochester was remarkable in King Charles's time, for being a
very witty and dissolute place, as I have read in books.</p>

<p>"At Canterbury we stopped ten minutes to visit all the
remarkable buildings and curiosities in it, and about its
neighbourhood; the church is beautiful: when Oliver Cromwell
conquered William the Third, he perverted it into a
stable&mdash;the stalls are still standing&mdash;the old Virgin who
shewed us the church, wore buckskin breeches and powder&mdash;he
said it was an archypiscopal sea, but I saw no sea, nor do
I think it possible he could see it either, for it is at least
seventeen miles off&mdash;we saw Mr. Thomas à Beckett's tomb&mdash;my
poor husband was extremely intimate with the old gentleman,
and one of his nephews, a very nice man, who lives
near Golden-square, dined with us twice, I think, in London&mdash;in
Trinity Chapel is the monument of Eau de Cologne,
just as it is now exhibiting at the Diarrea in the Regent's
Park.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span></p>

<p>"It was late when we got to Dover: we walked about
while our dinner was preparing, looking forward to our snug
<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">tête-à-tête</i> of three&mdash;we went to look at the sea, so called,
perhaps, from the uninterrupted view one has, when upon it&mdash;it
was very curious to see the locks to keep in the water
here, and the keys which are on each side of them, all ready,
I suppose, to open them if they were wanted.</p>

<p>"Mr. Fulmer looked at a high place, and talked of Shakspeare,
and said out of his own head, these beautiful lines.&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<p class="verse10">"Half way down</p>
<p class="verse5">Hangs one that gathers camphire, dreadful trade."</p>
</div></div></div>

<p>"This, I think it but right to say, I did not myself see.&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<p class="verseq">"Methinks he seems no bigger than his head,</p>
<p class="verse">The fishermen that walk upon the beach</p>
<p class="verse">Appear like mice."</p>
</div></div></div>

<p>"This, again, I cannot quite agree to, for where we stood,
they looked exactly like men, only smaller, which I attribute
to the effect of distance&mdash;and then Mr. Fulmer said this&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<p class="verse8">"And yon tall anchoring bark</p>
<p class="verse">Diminished to her cock&mdash;her cock a boy!"</p>
</div></div></div>

<p>"This latter part I do not in the least understand, nor
what Mr. Fulmer meant by cock a boy&mdash;however, Lavinia
seemed to comprehend it all, for she turned up her eyes and
said something about the immortal bird of heaven&mdash;so I
suppose they were alluding to the eagles, which doubtless
build their aviaries in that white mountain&mdash;(immortal bard
of Avon, the lady means).</p>

<p>"After dinner we read the Paris Guide, and looked over
the list of all the people who had been incontinent during the
season, whose names are all put down in a book at the inn,
for the purpose&mdash;we went to rest, much fatigued, knowing
that we should be obliged to get up early, to be ready for
embrocation in the packet in the morning.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span></p>

<p>"We were, however, awake with the owl, and a walking
a way before eight, we went to see the castle&mdash;which was
built, the man told us, by Seizer, so called, I conclude, from
seizing whatever he could lay his hands on&mdash;the man said
moreover that he had invaded Britain and conquered it, upon
which I told him that if he repeated such a thing in my presence
again, I should write to Mr. Peel about him.</p>

<p>"We saw the inn where Alexander, the Autograph of all
the Russias, lived when he was here, and as we were going
along, we met twenty or thirty dragons mounted on horses,
the ensign who commanded them was a friend of Mr. Fulmer's&mdash;he
looked at Lavinia, and seemed pleased with her
<em>Tooting assembly</em>&mdash;he was quite a <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">sine qua non</i> of a man, and
wore tips on his lips, like Lady Hopkins's poodle.</p>

<p>"I heard Mr. Fulmer say he was a son of Marr's; he
spoke it as if every body knew his father, so I suppose he
must be the son of the poor gentleman, who was so barbarously
murdered some years ago, near Ratcliffe Highway: if
he is, he is uncommon genteel.</p>

<p>"At twelve o'clock we got into a boat and rowed to the
packet; it was very fine and clear for the season, and Mr.
Fulmer said he should not dislike pulling Lavinia about, all
the morning: this I believe was a naughtycal phrase, which I
did not rightly comprehend, because Mr. F. never offered to
talk in that way on shore, to either of us.</p>

<p>"The packet is not a parcel as I imagined, in which we
were to be made up for exportation, but a boat of considerable
size; it is called a cutter&mdash;why, I do not know, and did not like
to ask. It was very curious to see how it rolled about&mdash;however
I felt quite mal-apropos, and instead of exciting any of
the soft sensibilities of the other sex, a great unruly man, who
held the handle of the ship, bid me lay hold of a companion,
and when I sought his arm for protection, he introduced me
to a ladder, down which I ascended into the cabin, one of
the most curious places I ever beheld, where ladies and gentlemen
are put upon shelves like books in a library, and where<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span>
tall men are doubled up like boot-jacks, before they can be
put away at all.</p>

<p>"A gentleman in a hairy cap without his coat, laid me perpendicularly
on a mattress, with a basin by my side, and said
that was my birth; I thought it would have been my death,
for I never was so indisposed in all my life. I behaved extremely
ill to a very amiable middle-aged gentleman with a
bald head, who had the misfortune to be attending upon his
wife, in the little hole under me.</p>

<p>"There was no symphony to be found among the tars, (so
called from their smell) for just before we went off I heard
them throw a painter overboard, and directly after, they called
out to one another to hoist up an ensign. I was too ill to
enquire what the poor young gentleman had done, but after
I came up stairs I did not see his body hanging anywhere, so
I conclude they had cut him down; I hope it was not young
Mr. Marr a venturing after my Lavy.</p>

<p>"I was quite shocked to find what democrats the sailors
are&mdash;they seem to hate the nobility, and especially the law
lords: the way I discovered this apathy of theirs to the
nobility, was this&mdash;the very moment we lost sight of England
and were close to France, they began, one and all, to swear
first at the peer, and then at the bar, in such gross terms as
made my very blood run cold.</p>

<p>"I was quite pleased to see Lavinia sitting with Mr. Fulmer
in the travelling carriage on the outside of the packet. But
Lavinia afforded great proofs of her good bringing up, by
commanding her feelings&mdash;it is curious what could have
agitated the billiary ducks of my stomach, because I took
every precaution which is recommended in different books to
prevent ill-disposition. I had some mutton chops at breakfast,
some Scotch marmalade on bread and butter, two eggs,
two cups of coffee and three of tea, besides toast, a little
fried whiting, some potted charr, and a few shrimps, and after
breakfast I took a glass of warm white wine negus, and a few
oysters, which lasted me till we got into the boat, when I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span>
began eating gingerbread nuts, all the way to the packet, and
then was persuaded to take a glass of bottled porter to keep
every thing snug and comfortable."</p>

HIGGINBOTTOM AND RAMSBOTTOM.</h3>

<p class="center smcap">To John Bull.</p>

<p class="right small">Montague Place, Dec. 24, 1823.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sir</span>,&mdash;I never wished either my wife or daughter to turn
authoresses, as I think ladies which write books are called,
and I should have set my face against the publication of my
wife's Journal of her Tour if I had been consulted; but the
truth is, they seldom ask me anything as to what is to be
done, until they have first done it themselves.</p>

<p>Now I like you, because you have done the West Indians a
good turn, and also because you try to put down the papishes;
but there <em>is</em> a thing which under all the circumstances
vexes me, because, as you may remember, Mr. Burke said,
"anything which is worth doing is worth doing well." What
I quarrel with you for is, that you put my wife's name and
my daughter's name as Mrs. and Miss Higginbottom, whereas
our name is Ramsbottom, and whether it be the stupidity of
your printers, or that my daughter, who has been three years
at an uncommon fine school at Hackney, cannot write plain,
I do not pretend to say; but I do not like it, because, since
every tub should stand on its own bottom, I think the Higginbottoms
should not have the credit of doing what the
Ramsbottoms actually do.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span></p>

<p>Perhaps you will correct this little error: it hurts me,
because, as I said before, I like you very much, and I have
got a few cases of particular champagne, a wine which my
friend Rogers tells me, you are extremely fond of, and
which he says is better than all the "real pain" in the
world&mdash;(nobody ever said it before); and when the women
return from over the horrid sea, I hope you will come and
drink some of it; so pray just make an <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">erratum</i>, as the
booksellers say, and put our right names in your paper, by
doing which you will really oblige, your's,</p>

as clever as Lavy, and writes a much clearer hand&mdash;you

MISS LAVINIA RAMSBOTTOM FORWARDS THE CONTINUATION

<p class=" center smcap">To John Bull.</p>

<p class="right small">Paris, Dec. 28, 1823.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dear Mr. B.</span>,&mdash;I never was so surprised in my life as
when we got your paper here, to see that your printing people
had called Ma' and me Higginbottom&mdash;I was sure, and I told
Ma' so, that it could not be your fault, because you could
not have made such a mistake in my handwriting, nor could
you have forgotten me so much as to have done such a thing;
but I suppose you were so happy and comfortable with your
friends (for judging by the number of your enemies you
must have a host of them) at this merry season, that you
did not pay so much attention to your correspondents as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span>
usual. I forgive you, my dear Mr. B.&mdash;Christmas comes but
once a-year, and I assure you we had a small lump of roast
beef (<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">portion pour deux</i>) from M. Godeau's, over the way, to
keep up our national custom&mdash;the man actually asked Ma'
whether she would have a <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">rost-bif de mouton</i>; so little do
they know anything about it. I send another portion of
Ma's diary&mdash;you spelt it "dairy" in the paper&mdash;I don't
know whether Ma' put it so herself&mdash;she is quite pleased at
seeing it published, and Mr. Fulmer called and said it was
capital.</p>

<p>We have just come from the Ambassador's chapel, and are
going to see St. Cloud directly, so I cannot write much myself,
but must say adieu.&mdash;Always believe me, dear Mr. B.,
yours truly,</p>

<p class="center wsp">ENGLAND AND FRANCE,</p>

<p class="center smcap wsp">By Dorothea Julia Ramsbottom.</p>

<p class="center">(<em>Continued.</em>)</p>

<p>"When we came near the French shore, a batto (which is
much the same as a boat in England) came off to us, and, to
my agreeable surprise, an Englishman came into our ship;
and I believe he was a man of great consequence, for I overheard
him explaining some dreadful quarrel which had taken
place in our Royal Family.</p>

<p>"He said to the master of our ship, that owing to the
Prince Leopold having run foul of the Duchess of Kent while
she was in stays, the Duchess had missed Deal. By which
I conclude it was a dispute at cards&mdash;however, I want to
know nothing of state secrets, or I might have heard a great
deal more, because it appeared that the Duchess's head was
considerably injured in the scuffle.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span></p>

<p>"I was very much distressed to see that a fat gentleman
who was in the ship, had fallen into a fit of perplexity by
over-reaching himself&mdash;he lay prostituted upon the floor, and
if it had not been that we had a doctor in the ship, who immediately
opened his temporary artery and his jocular vein,
with a lancelot which he had in his pocket, I think we should
have seen his end.</p>

<p>"It was altogether a most moving spectacle&mdash;he thought
himself dying, and all his anxiety in the midst of his distress
was to be able to add a crocodile to his will, in favour of his
niece, about whom he appeared very sanguinary.</p>

<p>"It was quite curious to see the doctor fleabottomize the
patient, which he did without any accident, although it blew
a perfect harrico at the time. I noticed two little children,
who came out of the boat, with hardly any clothes on them,
speaking French like anything&mdash;a proof of the superior education
given to the poor in France, to that which they get in
England from Dr. Bell of Lancaster.</p>

<p>"When we landed at Callous, we were extremely well received,
and I should have enjoyed the sight very much, but
Mr. Fulmer, and another gentleman in the batto, kept
talking of nothing but how turkey and grease disagreed with
each other, which, in the then state of my stomach, was far
from agreeable.</p>

<p>"We saw the print of the foot of Louis Desweet, the
French King, where he first stopped when he returned to his
country&mdash;he must be a prodigious heavy man to have left
such a deep mark in the stone&mdash;we were surrounded by Commissioners,
who were so hospitable as to press us to go to
their houses without any ceremony. Mr. Fulmer showed
our pass-ports to a poor old man, with a bit of red ribband
tied to his button-hole, and we went before the Mayor, who
is no more like a Mayor than my foot-boy.</p>

<p>"Here they took a subscription of our persons, and one
of the men said that Lavinia had a jolly manton, at which
the clerks laughed, and several of them said she was a jolly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span>
feel, which I afterwards understood meant a pretty girl&mdash;I
misunderstood it for fee, which, being in a public office, was
a very natural mistake.</p>

<p>"We went then to a place they call the Do-Anne, where they
took away the pole of my baruch&mdash;I was very angry at this,
but they told me we were to travel in Lemonade with a
biddy, which I did not understand, but Mr. Fulmer was
kind enough to explain it to me as we went to the hotel,
which is in a narrow street, and contains a garden and court-yard.</p>

<p>"I left it to Mr. Fulmer to order dinner, for I felt extremely
piquant, as the French call it, and a very nice dinner it was&mdash;we
had a purey, which tasted very like soup&mdash;one of the
men said it was made from leather, at least so I understood,
but it had quite the flavour of hare; I think it right here to
caution travellers against the fish at this place, which looks
very good, but which I have reason to believe is very unwholesome,
for one of the waiters called it poison while
speaking to the other&mdash;the fish was called marine salmon, but
it looked like veal cutlets.</p>

<p>"They are so fond of Buonaparte still that they call the
table-cloths Naps, in compliment to him&mdash;this I remarked to
myself, but said nothing about it to anybody else, for fear of
consequences.</p>

<p>"One of the waiters, who spoke English, asked me if I
would have a little Bergami, which surprised me, till Mr.
Fulmer said it was the wine he was handing about, when I
refused it, preferring to take a glass of Bucephalus.</p>

<p>"When we had dined we had some coffee, which is here
called cabriolet; after which Mr. Fulmer asked if we would
have a chasse, which I thought meant a hunting party, and
said I was afraid of going out into the fields at that time of
night&mdash;but I found chasse was a lickure called <em>cure a sore</em>
(from its healing qualities, I suppose), and very nice it was&mdash;after
we had taken this, Mr. Fulmer went out to look at the
jolly feels in the shops of Callous, which I thought indiscreet<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span>
in the cold air; however, I am one as always overlooks the
little piccadillies of youth.</p>

<p>"When we went to accoucher at night, I was quite surprised
in not having a man for a chambermaid; and if it had
not been for the entire difference of the style of furniture, the
appearance of the place, and the language and dress of the
attendants, I never should have discovered that we had
changed our country in the course of the day.</p>

<p>"In the morning early we left Callous with the Lemonade,
which is Shafts, with a very tall post-boy, in a violet-coloured
jacket, trimmed with silver; he rode a little horse, which is
called a biddy, and wore a nobbed tail, which thumped
against his back like a patent self-acting knocker. We saw,
near Bullion, Buonaparte's conservatory, out of which he
used to look at England in former days.</p>

<p>"Nothing remarkable occurred till we met a courier a
travelling, Mr. Fulmer said, with despatches; these men
were called couriers immediately after the return of the
Bonbons, in compliment to the London newspaper, which
always wrote in their favour. At Montrule, Mr. Fulmer
shewed me Sterne's Inn, and there I saw Mr. Sterne himself,
a standing at the door, with a French cocked hat upon
his head, over a white night-cap. Mr. Fulmer asked if he
had any becauses in his house; but he said no: what they
were I do not know to this moment.</p>

<p>"It is no use describing the different places on our rout,
because Paris is the great object of all travellers, and therefore
I shall come to it at once&mdash;it is reproached by a revenue
of trees; on the right of which you see a dome, like that of
St. Paul's, but not so large. Mr. Fulmer told me it was an
invalid, and it did certainly look very yellow in the distance;
on the left you perceive Mont Martyr, so called from the
number of windmills upon it.</p>

<p>"I was very much surprised at the height of the houses,
and the noise of the carriages in Paris: and was delighted
when we got to our hotel, which is Wag Ram; why I did<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span>
not like to enquire; it is just opposite the Royal Timber-yard,
which is a fine building, the name of which is cut in
stone.&mdash;<em>Timbre Royal.</em></p>

<p>"The hotel which I have mentioned is in the Rue de la
Pay, so called from its being the dearest part of the town.
At one end of it is the place Fumdum, where there is a
pillow as high as the Trojan's Pillow at Rome, or the pompous
pillow in Egypt; this is a beautiful object, and is made
of all the guns, coats, waistcoats, hats, boots and belts, which
belonged to the French who were killed by the cold in Prussia
at the fire of Moscow.</p>

<p>"At the top of the pillow is a small apartment, which
they call a pavillion, and over that a white flag, which I
concluded to be hoisted as a remembrance of Buonaparte,
being very like the table-cloths I noticed at Callous.</p>

<p>"We lost no time in going into the gardens of the
Tooleries, where we saw the statutes at large in marvel&mdash;here
we saw Mr. Backhouse and Harry Edney, whoever they
might be, and a beautiful grope of Cupid and Physic, together
with several of the busks which Lavy has copied, the original
of which is in the Vacuum at Rome, which was formerly an
office for government thunder, but is now reduced to a stable
where the Pope keeps his bulls.</p>

<p>"Travellers like us, who are mere birds of prey, have no
time to waste, and therefore we determined to see all we
could in each day, so we went to the great church, which is
called Naughty Dam, where we saw a priest doing something
at an altar. Mr. Fulmer begged me to observe the knave of
the church, but I thought it too hard to call the man names
in his own country, although Mr. Fulmer said he believed he
was exercising the evil spirits in an old lady in a black cloak.</p>

<p>"It was a great day at this church, and we staid for mass,
so called from the crowd of people who attend it&mdash;the priest
was very much incensed&mdash;we waited out the whole ceremony,
and heard Tedium sung, which occupied three hours.</p>

<p>"We returned over the Pont Neuf, so called from being the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span>
north bridge in Paris, and here we saw a beautiful image of
Henry Carter; it is extremely handsome, and quite green&mdash;I
fancied I saw a likeness to the Carters of Portsmouth, but
if it is one of his family, his posteriors are very much diminished
in size and figure.</p>

<p>"Mr. Fulmer proposed that we should go and dine at a
tavern called Very&mdash;because every thing is very good there;
and accordingly we went, and I never was so malapropos in
my life&mdash;there were two or three ladies quite in nubibus; but
when I came to look at the bill of fare, I was quite anileated,
for I perceived that Charlotte de Pommes might be sent for
for one shilling and twopence, and Patty de Veau for half-a-crown.
I desired Mr. Fulmer to let us go; but he convinced
me there was no harm in the place, by shewing me a
dignified clergyman of the Church of England and his wife,
a eating away like any thing.</p>

<p>"We had a voulez vous of fowl, and some sailor's eels,
which were very nice, and some pieces of crape, so disguised
by the sauce that nobody who had not been told what it
was would have distinguished them from pancakes&mdash;after the
sailor's eels we had some pantaloon cutlets, which were
savoury&mdash;but I did not like the writing paper&mdash;however, as it
was a French custom, I eat every bit of it&mdash;they call sparrow-grass
here asperge, I could not find out why.</p>

<p>"If I had not seen what wonderful men the French cooks
are, who actually stew up shoes with partridges, and make
very nice dishes too, I never could have believed the influence
they have in the politics of the country&mdash;everything is now
decided by the cooks, who make no secret of their feelings,
and the party who are still for Buonaparte call themselves
traitors, while those who are partizans of the Bonbons are
termed Restaurateurs, or friends of the Restoration.</p>

<p>"After dinner a French monsheur, who I thought was a
waiter, for he had a bit of red ribbon at his button-hole, just
the same as one of the waiters had, began to talk to Mr.
Fulmer, and it was agreed we should go to the play&mdash;they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span>
talked of Racing and Cornhill, which made me think the
mounsheur had been in England&mdash;however, it was arranged
that we were to go and see Andrew Mackay at the Francay,
or Jem Narse, or the Bullvards; but at last it was decided
unanimously, crim. con. that we should go to see Jem Narse,
and so we went&mdash;but I never saw the man himself after all.</p>

<p>"A very droll person, with long legs and a queer face, sung
a song which pleased me very much, because I understood
the end of it perfectly&mdash;it was 'tal de lal de lal de lal,' and
sounded quite like English&mdash;after he had done, although
every body laughed, the whole house called out 'beast,
beast,' and the man, notwithstanding, was foolish enough to
sing it over again."</p>

ADVENTURES AT PARIS.</h3>

<p class="center smcap">To Mr. Bull.</p>

<p class="right small">Paris, January 28, 1824.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sir</span>,&mdash;As my daughter Lavy, who acts as my amaranthus,
is ill-disposed with a cold and guittar, contracted by visiting
the Hecatombs last week, I send this without her little billy
which she usually sends; my second daughter has sprained
her tender hercules in crossing one of the roues, and my
third daughter has got a military fever, which, however, I
hope, by putting her through a regiment, and giving her a
few subterfuges, will soon abate. I am, however, a good deal
<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">embracée</i>, as the French say, with so many invalids.</p>

<p>Since I wrote last, I have visited the Hullaballoo, or cornmarket,
so called from the noise made in it; Mr. Fulmer told
me I should see the flower of the French nation there, but I
only saw a crowd of old men and old women; here is a pillow
made for judicious astronomy, but which looks like a sun-dial.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a></span></p>

<p>We went, on Tuesday, to the symetery of the Chaise-and-pair,
as they call it, where the French and English are miscellaneously
interred, and I amused myself by copying the epigrams
on the tombstones&mdash;one of them, which looked like a large
bath, Mr. Fulmer told me was a sark of a goose, which I had
previously heard my friend Mr. Rogers call Mr. Hume's shirt.</p>

<p>In the afternoon we went to dine at Beau Villiers's&mdash;not
the Mr. Villiers who owes our Government so much money&mdash;but
the smell of the postillions which were burning in the
rooms quite overpowered me. I got better in the evening,
and as the girls were not with us, Mr. Fulmer took me round
the Palais Royal, which is a curious place indeed. We saw
several Russian war houses, and went into the "Caffee de
Milk alone," so called because, when Bonypart confisticated
the cargoes from the West Indies, and propagated the use of
coffee, the lady who kept this place made a mixture with milk
alone, which answered all the purpose of coffee. The room
is surrounded by looking-glasses, so that the people are always
multiplying who go there: the lady herself was very
beautiful, but Mr. Fulmer told me she was constantly reflected
upon. Mr. F. took some melted glass, upon which I did not
like to venture, but contented myself with a tumbler of caterpillar
and water.</p>

<p>Wednesday we went to the Shampdemars (which is opposite
to the Pere Elisée), and saw a review of the Queerasses of
the Royal Guard. The sister of the late Dolphin was present&mdash;the
Dolphin of France is the same as the Prince of Whales
in England. The Duke of Anglehome came by, from hunting,
just at the time; I am told he is quite a Ramrod in the chace.
The troops performed their revolutions with decision, and
having manured all over the ground, fired a fille de joy, and
returned to their quarters.</p>

<p>We went yesterday to what is their Parliament House, and
while were a waiting in the antic-room, I saw a picture of
Lewes de Sweet himself, in a large purple robe, lined with
vermin and covered with fleur de lice. Being a stranger, I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span>
was allowed to look into the chamber; it is not quite what I
expected: there seemed to be a man in a bar, with a bell
before him, and the men who were speaking spoke all in
French, and looked very shabby and mean; to be sure, they
were only the deputies&mdash;it would have been more lucky if
we had seen the members themselves.</p>

<p>Lavy, I think, has got a puncheon for Mr. Fulmer, and I
am afraid is a fretting about it, but this is quite cet a dire
between us, Mr. B. He says her figure is like the Venus de
Medicine, which is no doubt owing to the pulling down she
has had of late. We are going next week to Sanclew again,
but we travel in such an odd carriage, that I cannot prevail
upon myself to mention its name.</p>

<p>You must excuse a short letter to-day. I was determined
to write, else I thought our friends in Westminster might be
disappointed. You shall hear more at large by the next
opportunity.</p>

<p class="right padr6">Always yours,</p>
<p class="right smcap wsp">D. J. Ramsbottom.</p>

<p>If you see Mr. R., tell him Mr. Fulmer has bought him
two pictures; one of Ten Years, the other of Old Beans; I
am no judge, but they are very black, and shine beautifully&mdash;they
are considered shift doovers in these parts.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">My dear Bull</span>,&mdash;I believe I shall soon have to announce
that Mr. Fulmer has led my Lavy to the halter&mdash;but I am
unwilling to be too sanguinary; should that happen, however,
we shall extend our tower, and proceed to the Pay de Veau<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a></span>
and finally to Room, where Mr. Fulmer is to explain all the
antics, what you so well know are collected there.</p>

<p>We have been to-day to see the Hotel de Veal, so called,
I believe, from being situated in the Calf-market; it is now
styled the Place de Grave, because all the malefactors who
are decimated by the gulleting (an instrument so called from
its cutting the sufferer's throat) are buried there. We crossed
over the Pont Neuf, in order to go again to see the Mass. As
we went along, I purchased two beautiful sieve jars, with
covers, on purpose to keep Popery in.</p>

<p>I believe I forgot to say that we went one morning to an
expedition of pictures at the Looksombre palace, so called
from its dull situation. It was very fine: one particularly
struck my fancy. It was Phœbe offering Hector to the Gods.
There was another of Morpheus charming the Beasts, which
was extremely moving; there was also a beautiful portrait of
a lady, and Mr. Fulmer said she was in excellent keeping. I
did not, of course, ask who she was, and I wonder how they
can admit likenesses of that class of people into such a place.
Mr. Fulmer shewed me a large picture, painted by David,
which is wonderfully fresh, considering its vast age. I knew
David was the greatest musician of his time, but I did not
know that he was a painter into the bargain. These genuses
are always gifted creturs.</p>

<p>We have been to the Jardin des Plantes, or place for wild
beasts, where we saw some lepers and tygers&mdash;and two birds
called carraways, from India; there is also an oliphant, which
contradicts the absurd story that these animals carry their trunks
about with them&mdash;this great creature had nothing but a long
snout, which made him look to me as if his tail had been misplaced&mdash;it
was intended by Bonypart to put the statute of one
of these animals up, for a fountain on the Bullwards, indeed
the impediment is already constructed.</p>

<p>I was very much delighted with the place Louis Quinzy&mdash;so
called from his having died of a sore throat&mdash;the Admiralty
is situated here, with a dollygraph on the top&mdash;Mr. Fulmer<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span>
introduced me to one of the officers in the naval department,
who was a very favourable specimen of the French moreen.</p>

<p>We went to the Odium, a favourite playhouse of Bonypart's,
on purpose to see the Civil Barber, a play written by one
Beau Marchy&mdash;but we were disappointed, for the house was
not open, so by way of a pease-alley, as Mr. Fulmer calls it,
we went to the Fait d'Eau, a kind of French uproar, where
we paid very dear for tickets, and got no places after all. I
was quite sick and tired of the affair altogether, and if Mr.
Fulmer had not got me a caffé au lait to carry me home, I
think I should have perspired from fatigue.</p>

<p>I had almost forgot to tell you that we went to the palace
at Marselles, distant from this about ten miles&mdash;it is indeed a
beautiful place. There we saw the great Owes playing, which
is water-works, and represents water coming out of the tails
of Lions, and out of the ears and noses of frogs and goddesses,
as natural as the life. Here is a wonderful fine chapel,
all of marvel, and a strait canal which has no end&mdash;I forget
how much it cost the nation to make all this water, but I am
sure it is cheap at the money whatever it may be&mdash;though by
the name it seems to be still owing. Mr. Fulmer called such
an expense an easy mode of liquidating a national debt&mdash;but
really I don't know why.</p>

<p>I have little time for more at present, because two of the
doctors from the Sore-bone are coming to see my daughter's
sprained ancle to-night; but it is curious to remark how
foolish the people are, when one has not a gentleman with one,
for Mr. Fulmer being out to-day, I sent to the Traitors for
the bill of fare, and the man talked of sending the dinner in a
cart, which I thought was useless, it being only just over the
way. So they sent the bill, and I not being particular, and
not understanding the names of the things, ordered the first
four dishes in the list, and they sent me four different sorts of
soup, and when I complained of the cook, the garkon or
waiter talked of quizzing and quizzing her, (doubtlessly
meaning me) as if I had been a person of no consequence&mdash;indeed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span>
he once or twice went so far as to swear at me, and
say dam when he spoke to me, but I had nobody at home to
take my part, and therefore I eat the four soups and said
nothing about it.</p>

<p>The daughter of Mr. Ratschild is going to be married&mdash;they
call him Creases, but he is a Jew. He gives her a dot
the day of her wedding, of five millions of franks; but for
all he is so rich, they say he is quite circumsized in his affairs
compared with his brother in London&mdash;his daughter will be
made a barrenness when she is married.</p>

<p>Mr. Cambray Serres is more&mdash;which here means no more.
I suppose, by his name, that he is related to our royal family
at home.</p>

<p>Do you know, Mr. Bull, that I have found out one very surprising
thing, the French ridicule the English in everything;
they have got a farce which they call "Anglase poor rear,"
which is quite scandalous, and every thing they have, they
nick-name after us; they call a note Billy, and a book Tom;
a pie they have christened Patty; they call the mob a fool;
any thing that is very shameful they call Hunt, but whether
they mean John, Henry, Joseph, or Leigh, I cannot discover&mdash;they
call the winter a heaver&mdash;the autumn Old Tom, and
the summer they call Letty.</p>

<p>I think the French must have been originally Irish, for they
say crame for cream, and suprame for supreme, and so on:
but I will endeavour to find out more about this.</p>

<p>I went to see a vealyard (that is, an old man), who had
been a sort of anchor-wright or hermit many years ago; he
had been put into the dungeons of the Inquisition in furs, and
suffered what they call the piano-forte and door of that
terrible place&mdash;if we go to Room we shall see the buildings
in which he was confined, and I dare say we shall go there,
and from that to Naples, and into the Gulp of Venus, and so
to Cecily, which I shall very much like whoever she may be,
because I knew a namesake of her's down in Dorsetshire.</p>

<p>I must, however, conclude my letter, for I am hurried for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span>
Tim&mdash;Lavy begs her best love, and says in case she is married
you must write her epitaph. Why do you not call upon Mr.
R.? he will be very glad to see you, and now that he is alone
he lives, in compliment to me, entirely upon turtle.</p>

MRS. RAMSBOTTOM BACK IN LONDON.</h3>

<p class="center smcap">To John Bull.</p>

<p class="right small">Montague Place, Friday, April 23, 1824.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">My dear Mr. Bull</span>,&mdash;I think you will be surprized at the
prescription of this letter with the P.P. mark of the two-penny
post; but poor Mr. Ramsbottom being seriously ill-disposed,
we were off from Paris at a moment's notice, for
as good fortune would have it, my embargo which I wrote
about was quite removed by the use of Steers's hopalittledog
and bang shows every night.</p>

<p>Mr. R. is a little better, and has lost a good deal of what
the French call song; indeed our medical man relies very
much on the use of his lancaulet. The fact is, that the
turtles is come over from the West Hinges, and Mr. R. committed
a fox paw at the King's Head, in the Poultry, which
caused our doctor (who lives in this neighbourhood, and is
lively as he is kind) to say that as Mr. Ramsbottom nearly
died by Bleaden, so bleeding must restore him. Bleaden
is the name of the gentleman who keeps the King's Head,
and bleeding, as you know, is the vulgar term for flea-bottomizing.</p>

<p>I fear you have not received my journal regular, nor do I
think I have told you of our seeing the Louver, which we
did the very day before we left Paris. I own, amongst the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span>
statutes, the Fighting Alligator pleased me most. As for
Rubens's pictures, I could not look at them; for though Mr.
Fulmer kept talking of the drapery, I saw no drapery at all;
and in one, which is of Adonass preventing Venice from
being chaste, the lady is sitting on a gold striped jacket.
Mr. Fulmer said she had got an enormous anacreonism, at
which Lavy laughed; so I suppose it had some allusion to her
favourite writer, Mr. Moore, who is called Anacreon&mdash;why,
I never could understand, unless it refers to the fashionable
Maladies which he has introduced into the best society.</p>

<p>A beautiful statute of Apollo with the Hypocrite pleased
me very much, and a Fawn which looks like a woman done
by Mons. Praxytail, a French stone-mason, is really
curious.</p>

<p>A picture of The Bicknells is I suppose a family grope,
but the young women appeared tipsy, which is an odd state
to be drawn in&mdash;the statute of Manylaws is very fine, and so
is Cupid and Physic, different from the one which I noticed
before.</p>

<p>Mr. Fulmer shewed us some small old black pictures,
which I did not look at much, because he told us they were
Remnants, and of course very inferior. A fine painting by
Carlo my Hearty pleased me, and we saw also something by
Sall Vataraso, a lady who was somehow concerned with the
little woman I have seen at Peckham Fair in former days,
called Lady Morgan.</p>

<p>We had one dinner at Riches, a coffee-house on the Bullwards,
and curious enough, it was the very day that poor
Mr. Ram overeat himself in the City&mdash;we had some stewed
Angles, and a couple of Pulls done up in a dish of Shoe;
which is much of a muchness with English fowl and cabbage&mdash;we
had afterwards an amulet of sulphur and some things
done in crumbs of bread, which they wanted to pass off upon
me as wheat-ears&mdash;but I had not lived at Brighton two
seasons for nothing, and do happen to know the difference
between wheat-ears and oysters; and so I told them.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[68]</a></span></p>

<p>Mr. Fulmer ordered a bottle of Oil of Purdry, which
tasted a good deal like Champaigne, but he said it was
mouse; the girls liked it, and Lavy laughed so loud that
she quite astonished an officer of Chindammery who was
drinking cafe at the next table.</p>

<p>I have left my third and fourth daughters in Paris, to
finish their education&mdash;they will be taught every thing that
girls can be taught, and are to be regularly boarded every
day (without regard to its being Lent) for less than seventy
pounds per ann.; and they learn so many more things in
France than girls do in England, that when they return they
might set up for mistresses themselves&mdash;what an advantage
there must be to a young woman, who is likely to have
occasion for it in her latter end, in a continent education&mdash;they
call these schools puncheons.</p>

<p>I desired, of course, that the Popish Prater, or priest,
might have no communication with my girls&mdash;I don't approve
of what they call the horal confession&mdash;to be sure it is a
mere matter of feeling&mdash;but I saw one young lady in Saint
Surplice one day a confessing away to a fine handsome
Prater, and I thought it would have been much better done
in some more private place than a church. I understood
afterwards she was a lady who had been long married, but
her husband had no hair to his property, and she used to
come every day and confess to the Prater, and pray for a
child&mdash;poor thing, she seemed very much in earnest.</p>

<p>The onion of Lavy with Mr. Fulmer is postponed; his
ant is dead, and it would not be respectful to be married
while the dool (as the French call it) continues; I am driven
to the last moment, as Lavy and her sister are analyzing
themselves to go to see the great picture of Pompey, in the
Strand&mdash;Lavy means to write to you next week herself.

MRS. RAMSBOTTOM ANNOUNCES THE DEATH OF
HER HUSBAND AND DESCRIBES HER VISIT
TO ROME.</h3>

<p class="center smcap">To John Bull.</p>

<p class="right small">Montague Place, Jan. 6, 1825.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dear Mr. Bull</span>,&mdash;Why don't you write to us&mdash;or call?
We are all of us well, and none of us no more, as perhaps
you may suppose, except poor Mr. Ram.&mdash;of course you
know of his disease, it was quite unexpected, with a spoonful
of turtle in his mouth&mdash;the real gallipot as they call it.
However, I have no doubt he is gone to heaven, and my
daughters are gone to Bath, except Lavy, who is my pet,
and never quits me.</p>

<p>The physicians paid great attention to poor Mr. Ram.,
and he suffered nothing&mdash;at least that I know of. It was a
very comfortable thing that I was at home shay new, as the
French say, when he went, because it is a great pleasure to
see the last of one's relations and friends.</p>

<p>You know we have been to Room since you heard from us&mdash;the
infernal city as it is called&mdash;the seat of Poopery, and where
the Poop himself lives. He was one of the Carnals, and was
elected just before we was there: he has changed his name,
not choosing to disgrace his family. He was formerly
Doctor Dallyganger, but he now calls himself Leo, which
the Papists reverse, and call him Ole or Oleness. He is a
fine cretur, and was never married, but he has published
a Bull in Room, which is to let people commit all kind of
sin without impunity, which is different from your Bull,
which shoes up them as does any crime. He is not Poop
this year, for he has proclaimed Jew Billy in his place,
which is very good, considering the latter gentleman is a
general, and not of his way of thinking.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span></p>

<p>Oh, Mr. Bull, Room is raley a beautiful place.&mdash;We
entered it by the Point of Molly, which is just like
the Point and Sally at Porchmouth, only they call Sally
there Port, which is not known in Room. The Tiber
is not a nice river, it looks yellow; but it does the same
there as the Tames does here. We hired a carry-letty and
a cocky-olly, to take us to the Church of Salt Peter, which is
prodigious big:&mdash;in the center of the pizarro there is a basilisk
very high&mdash;on the right and left two handsome foundlings;
and the farcy, as Mr. Fulmer called it, is ornamented
with collateral statutes of some of the Apostates.</p>

<p>There is a great statute of Salt Peter himself, but Mr.
Fulmer thinks it to be Jew Peter, which I think likely too&mdash;there
were three brothers of the same name, as of course
you know&mdash;Jew Peter the fortuitous, the capillary, and toenails;
and it is curos that it must be him, for his toes are
kissed away by the piety of the religious debauchees who
visit his shin and shrine&mdash;Besides, I think it is Jew Peter,
because why should not he be worshipped as well as Jew
Billy?&mdash;Mr. Fulmer made a pun, Lavy told me, and said
the difference between the two Jew Billies was, that one
drew all the people to the <em>sinagog</em>, and the other set all the
people <em>agog to sin</em>&mdash;I don't conceive his meaning, which I
am afraid is a Dublin tender.</p>

<p>There was a large quire of singers, but they squeaked too
much to please me&mdash;and played on fiddles, so I suppose they
have no organs;&mdash;the priests pass all their time in dissolving
sinners by oracular confusion, which, like transmogrification,
is part of their doctoring&mdash;the mittens in the morning,
and whispers at night, is just equally the same as at Paris.</p>

<p>Next to Salt Peter's Church is the Church of Saint John
the Latter end, where the Poop always goes when he is first
made&mdash;there is another basilisk here covered with highro-griffins.</p>

<p>I assure you the Colocynth is a beautiful ruin&mdash;it was built
for fights, and Mr. Fulmer said that Hell of a gabbler, an<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[71]</a></span>
Emperor, filled his theatre with wine&mdash;what a sight of
marvels Mr. B. oh, so superb!&mdash;the carraway, and paring,
and the jelly and tea-cup, which are all very fine indeed.</p>

<p>The Veteran<a name="FNanchor_10" id="FNanchor_10"></a><a href="#Footnote_10" class="fnanchor">[10]</a> (which I used foolishly to call the Vacuum
till I had been there), is also filled with statutes&mdash;one is the
body of the angel Michael, which has been ripped to pieces,
and is therefore said to be Tore-so&mdash;but I believe this to be a
poetical fixture:&mdash;the statute of the Racoon is very moving,
its tail is prodigious long, and goes round three on 'em&mdash;the
Antipodes is also a fine piece of execution.</p>

<p>As for paintings there is no end to them in Room&mdash;Mr.
Raffles's Transmigration is I think the finest&mdash;much better
than his Harpoons:&mdash;there are several done by Hannah Bell
Scratchy,<a name="FNanchor_11" id="FNanchor_11"></a><a href="#Footnote_11" class="fnanchor">[11]</a> which are beautiful; I dare say she must be related
to Lady Bell, who is a very clever painter, you know, in
London. The Delapidation of St. John by George Honey<a name="FNanchor_12" id="FNanchor_12"></a><a href="#Footnote_12" class="fnanchor">[12]</a> is
very fine, besides several categorical paintings, which pleased
me very much.</p>

<p>The shops abound with Cammyhoes and Tallyhoes&mdash;which
last always reminded me of the sports of the field at home,
and the cunning of sly Reynolds a getting away from the
dogs. They also make Scally holies at Rome, and what they
call obscure chairs&mdash;but, oh Mr. B. what a cemetry there is
in the figure of Venus of Medicine, which belongs to the
Duke of Tusk and eye&mdash;her contortions are perfect.</p>

<p>We walked about in the Viccissitude, and hired a maccaroni,
or as the French, alluding to the difficulty of satisfying the
English, call them, a "lucky to please," and, of course,
exploded the Arch of Tightas and the Baths of Diapason.
Every day exposes something new there, to the lovers of
what they call the belly arty, who have made a great many
evacuations in the Forum. Poor Lavy, whom I told you was
fond of silly quizzing, fell down on the Tarpaulin Rock, in
one of her revelries&mdash;Mr. Fulmer said it would make a capital
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span>story when she got home, but I never heard another syllabub
about it.</p>

<p>One thing surprised me, the Poop (who wears three crowns
together, which are so heavy that they call his cap, a tirer)
is always talked of as Paw-paw, which seems very improper,
his Oleness was ill the last day we went to the Chapel at the
Choir and all, having taken something delirious the day
before at dinner; he was afterwards confined with romantic
gout; but we saw enough of him after, and it was curious to
observe the Carnals prostituting themselves successfully before
him&mdash;he is like the German corn plaster which Mr. Ram used
to use&mdash;quite unavailable.</p>

<p>However, Mr. B., the best part of all, I think, was our
coming home&mdash;I was so afraid of the pandittis, who were
all in trimbush with arquebasades and Bagnets that I had no
peace all the time we were on root&mdash;but I must say I liked
Friskhearty; and Tiffaly pleased me, and so did Miss Senis's
Villa and the Casket Alley; however home is home, be it
never so homely, and here we are, thank our stars.</p>

<p>We have a great deal to tell you, if you will but call upon
us&mdash;Lavy has not been at the halter yet, nor do I know when
she will, because of the mourning for poor Mr. Ram&mdash;indeed
I have suffered a great deal of shag green on account of his
disease, and above all have not been able to have a party on
Twelfth Night.</p>

MRS. RAMSBOTTOM OBJECTS TO BEING PUT
IN A PLAY.</h3>

<p class="right small">Elysium Row, Fulham, July 8, 1825.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">My dear B.</span>,&mdash;I am in a dreadful state&mdash;I see by the play
ills, that a Play about our family at Rhymes is in prepara<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[73]</a></span>tion
at Common Garden. When I saw the divertisement in
the <cite>Currier</cite>, I thought I should have perspired. I never was
at Rhymes. I saw my own King, God bless him, crowned&mdash;but
I neither saw Lues de Sweet nor Charles Deece done anything
to, nor never meant to go. What is the Santampoole
to me&mdash;I don't like Poopery, nor ever did. Pray do you
know Mr. Coleman (him as I spoke of before) the itinerary
surgeon at Pancras? I am told he cuts out what he likes, of
whatever appears at Common Garden, ever since the horses
was introduced&mdash;if you could contrive to get us emitted, I
should be much obligated. Lavy is in a perfect favour about
it; and if dear Mr. Ram was not diseased and in his grave, I
think he would have gone mad to see our names blackguarded
against the walls&mdash;besides, there's our cousins&mdash;them is
more angry than we. In short, I have no doubt but the Play
has been caused by some little peake against our family, and
I trust to your goodness to get it anniliated beforehand.&mdash;Your's,
ever, dear B.,</p>

MRS. RAMSBOTTOM WRITES FROM DIEPPE.</h3>

<p class="right small">Dippe, January 1, 1826.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dear Mr. B.</span>,&mdash;You have not heard from any on us for a
long time&mdash;indeed I have no spirts to write to any body, for
Lavy has been very mal indeed&mdash;we are stopping at Dippe,
so called as you know, from being a bathing-place, for I am
worried to death.</p>

<p>Our house in Montague-place, which since dear Mr. Ram's
disease I cannot think of stopping in, is still to let, which is
so much waste of money&mdash;it is a nice house, open behind to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span>
the Mewseum Jordans, and in front all the way to Highgate;
but I cannot get it off my hands. As for Mr. Ram's little
property in Gloucestershire, I never can go there, for my
lawyer tells me, although we might live there if we like, that
one of Mr. Ram's creditors has got a lion on the estate, and I
cannot think of going to expose myself to the mercy of a
wild cretur like that a running about&mdash;however, as the French
says, "<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">jamais esprit</i>,"&mdash;never mind&mdash;I cannot help it.</p>

<p>My son Tom, who is a groin up, is to be in the law himself,
indeed I have put him out to Grazing,<a name="FNanchor_13" id="FNanchor_13"></a><a href="#Footnote_13" class="fnanchor">[13]</a> under a specious
pleader&mdash;I should like him to be apprenticed to the Lord
Chancellor at once, and brought up to the business regular,
but I don't know how to get it managed&mdash;do you think Mr.
Harmer could put me in the way of it?</p>

<p>I only write to wish you the full complement of the season&mdash;we
are a good deal troubled with wind here, but otherwise
we are very snug, and there are several high-burning gentlemen
of very large property living in Dippe, who are kind
enough to dine with us almost every day. I like them&mdash;they
have no pride at all about them, and, to look at them, you
would not think they was worth a Lewy.</p>

<p>I take the advantage of a currier, who is in the Bureau
here, and is going over with despatches, just to tell you we
are alive&mdash;if you know anybody as wants an agreeable Rusin-hurby,
do recommend our house in M. P. I have no noose,
but am your's unhalterably,</p>

HASTINGS.</h3>

<p class="center smcap">To John Bull.</p>

<p class="right small">Eastey's Hotel, Common Garden, Oct., 1826.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dear B.</span>,&mdash;It will no doubt be a surprise to you to hear
that we are back in London; we landed from a French batow
at Hastings the day before yesterday, after a long stay upon
the continent. We were very much impeded on landing by
some sailors belonging to what I think is very properly called
the Blockhead service, who would not let my daughters pass
without looking all over them. Two men said they were the
customs there, which I thought very odd&mdash;one of them told
us he was <ins class="corr" title="Transcriber's Note&mdash;Original text: 'Couut Roller'">Count Roller</ins>, but I did not believe him.</p>

<p>My second daughter Amelrosa has at last got a swan of
her own, to whom she is about to be united in the silken
banns of Highman. I have but one objection&mdash;he is a French
Mounsheer, and do what I can they talk so fast I cannot understand
them: however, she <em>will</em> have him, nolus bolus, as the
man says; and when once her mind is made up, she is as
resolute as the laws of the Maids and Parsons.</p>

<p>Mr. Rogers, the banker, (I know you know him,) came over
with us in the batow, and made many very odd remarks&mdash;one
thing he said, at which every body laughed, I could not tell
why. My French footer son-in-law asked him what the shore
was called, which was close to Hastings. "Close to Hastings,"
said Mr. Rogers, "why, Jane Shore, I suppose." He is a
very old-looking genus for a whig wag&mdash;Mr. Fulmer said he
put him in mind of Confusion, the old Chinee philosopher,
who was a Mandolin in them parts a year or two ago.</p>

<p>Hastings is a beautiful place to my mind; there is a long
parade close to the water, where you may see all the company
bathing in the morning like so many dukes. At one end is
the place for the ladies, and at the other you see all the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[76]</a></span>
gentlemen's machines a standing, which are very properly kept
at a great distance from the female parts. The houses by the
side of this are very nice, and reminded me very much of
French houses, with shops under them, only there are no
portes cochons.</p>

<p>We met an old friend of ours at Hastings, who wanted us
to stop a few days, but she was very conspicious, for she
wore a black whale, by way of petticoat, and she and her two
daughters was all painted both red and white in the morning,
which had a very bad look; so we said we was engaged, and
came on as fast as we could&mdash;for I was glad enough to get
away from all the scurf and billies, which was a roaring upon
the bitch.</p>

<p>Where we are living now is in Southampton-street, and
was the house of Mr. Garrick, the author of "The School
for Scandal," and all Shakspeare's plays. The waiter tells us
that Mr. Johnston, of Covent-garden, and an old Goldsmith,
of the name of Oliver, used very often to dine with him in
the very room in which I write this, and that that excellent
and amiable man, Sir George Beaumont, who, as you know,
wrote half Mr. Fletcher's works, and who is alive and merry
at this moment, used to dine here too&mdash;but that, I think, is a
little trow four,<a name="FNanchor_14" id="FNanchor_14"></a><a href="#Footnote_14" class="fnanchor">[14]</a> for Garrick, I believe, has been dead more
than two hundred and fifty years.</p>

<p>I cannot let my house in Montague Place, because of the
new Universality in Gore Street&mdash;however, if I go and live
there, they say there will be a great many Bachelors in the
College, and perhaps I may get off one or two of my girls.
I write this while my French footer son-in-law is playing
Macarty with his Dulcimer Amelrosa&mdash;Macarty is, to my
mind, little better than a bad translation of all-fours into
French; but above all, I cannot bare to hear Mounsheer while
he is a playing, for whenever he has got the ace of spades
in his hand, he talks of a part of Derbyshire which is never
mentioned in decent society not by no means whatsoever.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[77]</a></span></p>
<p>In Paris we saw Mr. Cannon, the Secretary of State, but
without any state at all&mdash;he was just like any other man&mdash;and
as for his foreign affairs, I saw none that he had&mdash;he
was quite without pride&mdash;not at all like Count Potto o' de
Boggo, who is a great Plenipo there, and struts about just
as grand as the Roman Consols did, when they used to have
their Feces tied up in bundles and carried before them by
their Lickturs. I have no notion of paying such reverence
to officers of humane institution for my part, and I quite
love Mr. Cannon for his want of ostensibility.</p>

<p>We met with an uncommon unpleasant accident coming to
town&mdash;one of the horses, which was seized with the staggers,
a disorder very like St. Witulus's dance in men, broke his
breeches in going down an ill, which very nearly overturned
the carriage, which we had hired at Hastings; for of course
we had no coach in the batow, and were glad enough to
catch a couple of flies even in this cold season, to convey us
to Tunbridge Wells, a place I had never seen before, and
which is like Cranburn Alley put out to grass&mdash;there are
various ills about the neighbourhood, which are named after
Scripture, why I cannot tell&mdash;we did not drink any of the
waters, none of us being in any way deceased.</p>

<p>I think I have now taken leave of old Ossian for this
season, at all events; and as far as that goes, if I never see
the briny dip again I shall not fret, for though it is a very
good thing to breed fish in, I never want to be upon its billies
any more. I hope to leave this after Amelrosa is married,
which will be soon, I suppose, and the moment I do I will
write again; meanwhile, if you like to drop in to a tête-à-tête
of six, we shall always be glad to see you; and so believe
me, dear B., yours very truly,</p>

MRS. RAMSBOTTOM ON THE HOUSE OF COMMONS.</h3>

<p class="center smcap">To John Bull.</p>

<p class="right small">Montague Place, Russell Square, Feb. 1, 1827.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dear B.</span>,&mdash;You will be surprized at finding me back at the
old house&mdash;but we have not been able to get rid of it, so we
have resolved upon living in it till we can.</p>

<p>My second daughter, which married Monsheer Delcroy, is
<em>on saint</em>, which pleases him very much&mdash;he is quite a gentleman,
and has travailed all over Europe, and has seen all our
allies (which means the friendly Courts) upon the Continent&mdash;he
knows Lord Burgos, which is one of the Henvoys of
England, and was chosen to make overtures to some foreign
king&mdash;I think it was a very good choice, if <em>I</em> may judge; for
I heard one of his overtures the other night at a consort in
town, which was beautiful. My son-in-law also knows the
Admirable Sir Sidney Smith, what made such a disturbance
in Long Acre many years since, of which I cannot say I
know the rights.</p>

<p>I met your friend, Mr. Rogers, last week at a party, and
he made what the French call a tambourine (I think)&mdash;there
was a supper, and the lady of the house, whose husband is a
See captain, had some of the veal on table which had been
preserved in a pot, and carried out on a pole by Captain
Parry in his last voyage to Ireland, and when Mr. Rogers
heard what it was, he congratulated the lady that her husband
was appointed to a ship, for, says he, "I see, ma'am,
he has got the <em>Veal de Parry</em>!"&mdash;at which every body laughed&mdash;but
I don't know why, because the <em>Veal de Parry</em> is a
French word, and means the Mephistopholis of France.</p>

<p>My son-in-law (number one, as I call him) Fulmer, which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[79]</a></span>
married Lavy, is a Member of Parliament&mdash;he is put in by a
great man, whose name I cannot mention; he tells us a good
deal of what they do in the house&mdash;he says there are two
sets on 'em in there, one is called the Eyes and the other the
Nose&mdash;the Eyes is the government side, because they watch
over the people; and the Nose is them as tries to smell out
something wrong&mdash;Mr. Calcraft, Mr. Broom, and Mr. Denman,
and them belongs to the Nose party.</p>

<p>But what I never knew before is, that there is a coffee-house
and a bar there&mdash;the gentleman which keeps the coffee-house
is called <em>Belly-me</em>, and he gives them their dinner.
Fulmer says you may see many a man who has a stake in
the country taking his chop there; and, because sobriety is
considered a pint of decency, they never drink more than a
pint of wine with their vitals, which is very proper indeed.
This place has been famous for its beef-steaks ever since the
<em>rump</em> Parliament. I believe the House of Lords pays for
the dinners of the House of Commons, for I see they very
often carry up their bills to them.</p>

<p>There is another strange thing, which is, that the Speaker
has no voice, which I think very droll indeed&mdash;but what is
more curious still, is, that ladies are never admitted to see
the representation, as it is called; but sometimes they come
and peep through the venterlater, which is a hole in the top
to let out the smell, and so hears the speeches that way.</p>

<p>Talking of Mr. Broom; only think! our famous Hay-Tea
Company being resolved after all&mdash;I got some shares, because
I saw Mr. Broom's name to it, and because it was to do
away with slavery in China, where the present tea comes
from. I have lost a lump of money by <em>that</em>, and have been
very unfortunate all through with these Joint Company peculations.
Lavy has got three Real del Monte shares worth
110 premiums&mdash;those <em>I</em> had, I believe, were not <em>real</em> ones at
all, for I never got anything whatsoever by them.</p>

<p>Only think, Sir, of poor Mr. Prince Tollyrang being knocked
down while he was attending as chambermaid to the King,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[80]</a></span>
at Sandennie. They have got a joke now in France, my son-in-law
(Number too, as I calls him) told me yesterday&mdash;They
say, "il a reprit ses Culottes"&mdash;Culottes are things
which the Popish Priests wear upon their heads; and the
joke turns upon the difference between the culottes and
soufflets, which are amulets of eggs, of which I once before
wrote to you, from the other side of Old Ossian.</p>

<p>I should tell you that my Bowfeeze (as he calls himself)
Delcroy, is learning English very fast, but he will not do it
the wriggler way, but gets his Dicks and Harries, and so
puzzells out every word. We had a great laugh against him
the other day&mdash;</p>

<p>He was a coming home through St. Giles's (which is the
only way to this), and there was two women a fighting in
the street, and Delcroy he stood listening to hear what it was
all about; but doose a word could he make out, till at last
one of the women gave the other, what the fighters call a
Flora, and she tumbled down, and then the friends of her
agonist called out "Well done Peg," which Delcroy got into
his head, and come home all the way, a saying to himself,
"Well&mdash;done&mdash;Peg;" quite dissolved to find out what it
meant, in he comes&mdash;up stairs he goes&mdash;down comes his
Dicks and Harries, and out he finds the words&mdash;</p>

<p>First, he finds "Well"&mdash;an evacuation made in the earth
to find water;</p>

<p>Next he finds "Dun"&mdash;a colour betwixt black and
brown;</p>

<p>And last he finds "Peg"&mdash;a wooden nail.</p>

<p>Oh! then to hear him rave and swear about our Lang
Anglay&mdash;it was quite orrible&mdash;for he knew well enough, with
all his poking and groping, that that could not be the meaning;
so now, whenever he begins to try his fine scheme, my
girls (little toads) run after him and cry out "Well done Peg!"</p>

<p>I wish you would drop in and see us&mdash;we are all in the
family way here; but my two youngest daughters play very
pretty&mdash;one they say has as much execution as Muscles on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[81]</a></span>
the piano-forte, or Key-sweater on the fiddle; they play the
late Mr. Weaver's overture to Obrien uncommon well as a
do-it; the Roundo is very difficult they tell me&mdash;indeed I
know it must be a beautiful piece of music, because they
have printed <span class="fs70">FINE</span> in large letters at the end of it.</p>

<p>But I waist too much of your time&mdash;do come and take
your tea with us&mdash;we live a good deal out of the way, but
when you get down to the bottom of Oxford-street, ask anybody,
and they will tell you which road to take&mdash;it is all
lighted at night here, and watched just like London&mdash;do
come.</p>

MRS. RAMSBOTTOM ON THE CANNING
ADMINISTRATION.</h3>

<p class="center smcap">To John Bull.</p>

<p class="right small">Montague Place, Bedford Square,<br />
<span class="padr2">May 18, 1827.</span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dear B.</span>,&mdash;I am quite in a consternation&mdash;you are no
longer a supporter of Government, and I am&mdash;indeed several
ladies of my standing down in these parts have determined
to stick to the Canine Administration, which you oppose.
Mr. Fulmer takes in the <cite>Currier</cite>, and the <cite>Currier</cite> supports
them&mdash;besides, he knows the Duke of Deafonshire, and so
we cannot help being on their side.</p>

<p>You did not, perhaps, expect so soon to see Lord Doodley
in place, nor fancy Mr. Turney would be Master of the Mint,
or else you would not have been again Mr. Canine&mdash;for I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[82]</a></span>
know you like Lord Doodley, and you always praise Mr.
Turney.</p>

<p>Between you and me, I do not quite understand why they
should have so much Mint in the Cabinet as to want a man
to look after it, when they have no Sage there, nor do I see
how our Statesmen can get into a Cabinet to sit&mdash;to be sure,
the French Minister sits in a bureau, and one is quite as easy
to get into as the other. I see by Mr. Canine's speeches,
that the King (God bless him!) sits in a closet, which is much
more comfortable, I think.</p>

<p>Fulmer tells me that Mr. Broom's brother is the Devil, and
gets six or seven hundred a year by it&mdash;I always understood
he was related to the family, but never knew how, till Mr.
Canine's people got him a place at Court, which I think very
wrong, only I must not say so.</p>

<p>I was very near in a scrape on Monday. I went down to
Common Garden to buy some buckets for my Popery jars,
out of which I empty the Popery in summer, and put in
fresh nosegays, being a great votery of Floorar&mdash;when who
should be there but Mr. Hunt, and Mr. Cobbett, and Mr. Pitt,
the last of which gentlemen I thought had been dead many
years; indeed I should not have believed it was him, still
alive, only I heard Mr. Hunt call for his Old Van, which I
knew meant the President of our Anti-Comfortable Society
in Tattenham-court-road, who is a Lord now, and was a
friend of Mr. Pitt's before he retired from public life into the
Haddlefy.</p>

<p>Mr. Hunt told us a thing which I never knew before, which
is, that the pavement of Common-garden is made of blood
and prespiration, which is so curious that my two little girls
and I are going down Toosday to look at it&mdash;after hearing
him say that, I got away, but had my pocket picked of some
nice young inions, which I had just before bought.</p>

<p>Mr. Fulmer does not know I am riting to you, but I do
rite because I think it rite to do so, to warn you not to say
that Mr. Canine has gone away from what he was formerly&mdash;for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[83]</a></span>
I know as a fact that it was <em>he</em> which christened his
present friends "all the talons," and rote a pome in praise
of them, which he would not have done had he not thought
eyely of them.</p>

<p>It is not true that he is going to make any new Pears,
although his anymes says so. Mr. Russell, of Branspan, I
have known all my life&mdash;he smokes more than his coles, and
don't want to be a Lord at all; and as for Mr. Bearing, he
is a <em>transit land take</em> man, and cannot be a Lord here&mdash;at
least so F. tells me. However, I think Sir George Warrener
will be a Barren something, let what will happen elsewhere.
I see, however, Mr. Canine has made both Plunkett and
Carlile Lords, and given all the woods and forests to the
latter.</p>

<p>You see I begin to pick up the noose&mdash;<em>awnter noo</em>, as the
French say, have you seen our village clock in St. Giles's&mdash;it
is lited up by itself every heavening, at hate o'clock;
and on account of its bright colour, may be red at any hour
of the nite: it is, indeed, a striking object; if you should be
able to get out of town, do drive down this way and look
at it.</p>

<p>Only think of these Mr. Wakefields being put into gaol
for three years for marrying a young woman&mdash;I suppose
there is no chance of her being confined in consequence of
her going with them. Have you heard Madame Toeso? is
she any relation to Miss Foote? My papa is full, and so'il
hold no more, so adeu.</p>

<p class="right padr6">Yours truly,</p>

MRS. RAMSBOTTOM ON SMOKING.</h3>

<p class="center smcap">To John Bull.</p>

<p class="right small">August, 1827.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dear B.</span>,&mdash;I wish you would please to say something about
them nasty men what smokes about. I took my daughter
to Market last week in the <i>Columbine</i> packet, and there
not only did the ship smoke, but almost every man had either
a pipe or a seagar in his mouth.</p>

<p>I made a little fox pos on board, for I was so sick of the
smoking that one of the men said I had better go and sit
with the engineers, for let it be ever so hot they were used to
it and never smoked. Now when we was living on Blackheath,
poor Mr. Ram used to ask several of the engineers to
dine with us, which always come in a pretty uniform of
scarlet, with blue velvet facings, and which I knowed to be
a genteel corpse, because there were not no men in it, but all
officers. So I asked the gentlemen who talked of the engineers
to show me the way to them, thinking perhaps I might
see some of my old friends down there, but when I got into
the place, which was like a firnest, what should I see but
two or three men without their coats, with airy caps on their
heads and dirty faces, a shovelling in coles like anything&mdash;and
when I come down they laughed at me and asked if I
wanted to be roasted. I soon found out they was different
people from what I thought, and a gentleman who helped me
up out of the hole were they was a grubbing, told me the
difference was that the dirty men were civil engineers, which
I could by no means agree to&mdash;for I thought them uncommon
rude.</p>

<p>When I got up stairs again, I was sick of the smoking,
and so I went into the cabin, where there were more smokers&mdash;in
short, dear B., whether I travels by land or by water,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[85]</a></span>
still I am smoked to death&mdash;it is a most horrid custom, and,
perhaps, if you notice it, some on 'em will leave it off. I will
rite again when we are settled.&mdash;Yours truly,</p>

<p>Why is a gentleman in a Calais packet on a stormy day,
like a gentleman sailing in part of the Mediterranean?&mdash;Because
he is amongst the <em>Cyclades</em>.</p>

they are without number.</p>

<p>When is a door not a door?&mdash;When it is <em>a-jar</em>.</p>

A LETTER FROM CHELTENHAM.</h3>

<p class="center smcap">To John Bull.</p>

<p class="right small">Cheltenham, April 11, 1828.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">My dear B.</span>,&mdash;I have been prevented writing you of late;
two of my youngest daughters have had the mizzles, which
has been succeeded by a cough and considerable expectation,
but I have changed my doctor, and shall do uncommon well
now. The last person, who fancies himself a second Hippocrite,
had the impotence to say my girls had a low fever&mdash;girls
brought up as they have been, like duchesses&mdash;so I
said nothing; but when he called again, I was denied to him
and sent for his arrival; and we are all going on well, and
keep up our spirits accordingly.</p>

<p>A regiment is I believe the best thing after all; for I have
just discovered that Shakspeare, the mortal bird, as my son
calls him, died of indisgestion, which I did not know till my
new doctor told me so; he said, that poor Shakspeare was
quite destroyed by common tato's, which must have been
some coarse sort of the root in use in his time; and the
doctor also told me, that he was attended by a Doctor Johnson<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[88]</a></span>
and a Mr. Stevens; but I thought to myself, too many cooks
spoil the broth; and even my medical said he thought he
would have done better if they had left him alone. What
made us talk about the great swain of Avon was my saying
I thought She Stoops to Conquer a very droll play.</p>

<p>My son-in-law has bought a beautiful picture, a Remnant
undoubted; it is as black as your hat, and shines like a tea
tray, and is considered, as indeed it is, what the French call,
a <em>shade over</em> of that great master; he has also bought a jem
of considerable vallew; he says it is an antic of a dancing
fawn, but it looks to me like a man with a tail, a jumping.
He has got several very curious things at shops here; but he
goes poking his nose into all the oles and corners for curiosities,
and sometimes gets into sad scrapes; he is a French
Mounsheer, you recollect; and at one of the sails he scraped
acquaintance with a young dandy-looking man with dark
musquitos on his lips, which we had seen every morning a
drinking the waters regularly, and so we let him walk and
talk with us; and at last we was told that he was no better
than he should be, and had been convicted of purgery, which
I did not think so great a crime, considering where we was;
however, he is gone away, which I am glad of.</p>

<p>I told you my son-in-law was a French Mounsheer, but I
did not know till the other day that he was in the army, for
he has been so sly as never to mention it; but I saw one of
his letters from his elder brother, and in the direction he
called him Cadet, which after all is no very high rank, you
know. I should, however, have very much liked to have
seen the boys from the Miliary Asslum march to the Surrey
Theatre; it must have been a beautiful site; I suppose they
got leave through the Egerton General's office.</p>

<p>Have you read Lord Normandy's <cite>Yes or No</cite>, or Mr.
Liston's <cite>Herbert Lacy</cite>? I should think it must be very
droll, he is such a droll cretur himself; and pray tell me if
you have heard any news from Portingal of the Don. Major
Macpherson calls him Don <em>M'Gill</em>, and Captain O'Dogherty<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[89]</a></span>
calls him Don <em>My jewel</em>&mdash;how do you pronounce it? I am
told Lord Doodley used to call him, while he was in London,
<em>My gull</em>.</p>

<p>There is not much stirring here; the good effect of the
waters is quite aperient in our family; we are all mending,
and exorcise ourselves for four hours at a time on what is
called the well walk, which is a different place from the sick
walk, which is entirely for the innphaleeds. Lavinia has
got hold of a book called <cite>Bookarchy</cite>, containing the lives of
a hundred Knights, she says; but she won't shew it to her
sisters as is not yet marred; it is translated out of a foren
tongue by a Mr. D. Cameron; all the Scotch is very clever.</p>

<p>Mr. Fulmer is going to Hauksvut next term, to be made a
Doctor of Laws. He says he shall be away only two days, but
I doubt its being over so soon, because he told me himself it
must be done by degrees. After he is made a Doctor, he
says he means to practise; but I told him I thought he had
better practise first, in order to understand what he has to do
afterwards. A friend of his came here to see him from
Hauksvut College, who I thought was a clergyman by his
dress; but I found out, by what Mr. Fulmer told me, that it
was an old lady in disguise, for he said she was Margaret
Professor, and he even went so far as to call her a Divinity,
which to me did seem uncommon strange. However, there
is no understanding these scholars; for it is not more than a
fortnight since, that Fulmer told me he expected a brazen-nosed
man to dinner, and when the gentleman came, his nose
was just like other people's: so I suppose it was to surprise
Lavinia, who was reading a work on Nosology at the very
time.</p>

<p>You will be pleased to hear that I have let my house in
Montague Place, unfurnished with conveniences, for three
hundred and twenty pounds a-year, besides taxis; and I have
skewered a very nice residence in the Regent's Park, within
ten doors of the Call-and-see-um where the portrait of St.
Paul is to be exhibited, and where I hope you will visit us;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[90]</a></span>
my two youngest, which is a-shooten up, is uncommon anxious
to know you, now they have made their debutt into saucyity.
The young one is a feline cretur as ever trod shoe leather.
The other is more of an orty crackter, with very high spirts.
They are indeed quite Theliar and Molpomona of the Ramsbottoms.</p>

<p>If you should run down here before we leave for town,
pray come and take pot-luck, which is all we can offer you at
Cheltenham. You must take us as you find us: we are all
in the family way, and, as you know, delighted to see our
friends, without any ceremony.</p>

<p>Do right, dear B., and send us the noose; for really the
old Engines who are here for their health look so billyus,
that without something to enliven us, we should get worse
instead of better.</p>

HASTINGS AGAIN.</h3>

<p class="center smcap">To John Bull.</p>

<p class="right small">Hastings, July 8, 1828.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dear B.</span>,&mdash;Here we are, after a short tower to Dip in
France, in the esteem packet the <i>Tarbut</i>&mdash;my fourth has been
mylad, as the French say, and was recommended a little
voyage, and she picked up an old bow, which talked to her in
French, and called her a belley spree, which I thought was
impotence, but Lavinia said no, and reminded me of judy
spree, which is another gallowsism, as they style them&mdash;but
why they call this place green and young Hastings, which is
old and brown, I don't know&mdash;they are going, however, to
move it about a mile nearer Bexhill, to the stone where<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[91]</a></span>
William the Third landed when he had conquered the Normans&mdash;our
old bow said it was a capital sight for a town; but
as yet I couldn't see much, although everybody is taking the
houses before they are built.</p>

<p>We was a-staying with a couzen of mine near Lewis,
before we crossed the sea&mdash;he is married, and has a firm
hornee, which his wife calls a Russen hurby, it is so close to
the town, and yet so uncommon rural&mdash;the sheep he has, is
called marinos, because it is near the sea; and their wool is
so fine that they fold them up every night, which I had no
notion of&mdash;they have two sorts of them, one, which they call
the fine weather mutton, stays out all night, I believe, and
the other doesn't. But the march of intellect is agoing on,
for the dirty boys about the farm-yard, they told me, are sent
to Harrow, and the sheep themselves have their pens found
them every night; what to do I don't know, and I never like
to ask&mdash;at Battle, where there is an old abbé living&mdash;we did
not see him&mdash;they have built a large chapel for the Unicorns;
I scarcely know what sex they are&mdash;I know the Whistling
Methodists, because when Mr. Ram and I was young we used
to go to the meetin, and hear them preach like anything&mdash;there's
a great deal of religion in Sussex of one sort and
another.</p>

<p>My eldest, Mrs. Fulmer, has come here for her a-coach-man&mdash;Fulmer
wishes it may be a mail, because what they
have already is all gurls; if it hadn't been for that, I should
have gone to Mrs. Grimsditch's soreye at Hackney last
week, when I was to have been done out as Alderman
Wenables, but I was obliged to be stationary here. I was
so sorry to see in the noosepapers that when the Lord High
Admiral exhibited his feet on the 18th of June, Maria
Wood was dressed up so strange; they said that after she
had been painted, and some part of her scraped clean from
duck weed, they tied flags to her stays, and put a Jack into
her head, which I think quite wrong, because them Jacks is
uncommon insinuating.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[92]</a></span></p>

<p>I see that in Portingal Don Myjewel has got three estates,
but they cannot be very grand ones, if they produces only a
crown; however, I don't know what they mean in that
country, only as they call him real, I suppose he is the
rightful king&mdash;I don't henvy him, Mr. B.&mdash;there's many
happier than them as sets upon thorns, though they be
gilded ones.</p>

<p>We met one of the Engines here from Cheltenham&mdash;he
talks of returning to some friend of his in Hingy, I think he
called him Ben Gall. I know he spoke very familiar of him.
He has been at Stinkomalee, in Sealong, and at the Island of
Malicious, where a gentleman of the name of Paul killed himself
with Virginia. Our Engine said he was at Malicious and
at Bonbon at the time of the Conquest, which my Trusler's
Crononhotonthologos tells me was in the year 1072, which
makes his old appearance not surprising&mdash;he is very antick
indeed&mdash;he says he shall go out in a China ship, which sounds
to me very venturesome, but I suppose he knows what he is
about&mdash;he is going to Bombay, he tells us, to buy cotton,
but that, between you and me, is nonsense, because if that
was all, why could he not go to Flint's, in Newport-market,
where they sells every sort of cotton, all done up in nice
boxes ready for use?</p>

<p>One thing I heard about hunting while I was at the Firm
Hornee which I thought shocking. There is a Squire Somebody
which keeps a pack of beadles, and there is ever so
many of them&mdash;and they sleep in the kennell every night, and
a man is paid to whip them into it&mdash;but that is not the worst&mdash;they
feed them upon humane flesh. You would not scarce
credit this, but I heard my cousin say that he wondered this
hot weather did not hurt the dogs, for that they had nothing
to feed on but the Graves.&mdash;Do just touch them up for this&mdash;I
am sure they deserve it.</p>

<p>That selection for member of Parliament in Clare is very
strange, isn't it? Our old bow tells us that O'Connell can't
take his place because he won't swear against transportation,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[93]</a></span>
for he says it is one thing for a Papist to stand and another
for him to sit, which <em>enter noo</em> I could have told <em>him</em>&mdash;however,
he says he thinks O'Connell will go to the Pigeon
House strait from the selection. Of course I did not like
to ask what he wanted to do in such a place as a Pigeon
House, and so the conversation dropped; indeed, the bow
(as we call him) told us such a strange story about Mr.
O'Connell's getting to the top of a pole the first day, and
keeping up there for four days afterwards, that I begin to
think he tells tarrydiddles sometimes. He is very agreeable
though, and I believe he is rich, which is the mane point
when one has gurls to settle. He is always a making French
puns, which he calls cannon balls,<a name="FNanchor_15" id="FNanchor_15"></a><a href="#Footnote_15" class="fnanchor">[15]</a> but I never shall be much
of a parley vous, I did not take to it early enough.</p>

<p>We expect the Duke of Clarence to review the Blockhead
service on this coast, which will make us uncommon gay.
He will visit the <i>Ramlees</i>, which Captain Piggut commands,
at Deal, and the <i>Epergne</i>, Captain Maingay's ship, at New
Haven. I should like to go to Brighton, but Fulmer is
afraid of movin his better half while she is so illdisposed,
and expectin every minute; however, when that is over we
shall, I dare say, go to London, and hope to see you in our
new house. If you come here we shall delight in seeing you;
but I believe you like London, and never leaves the bills of
morality, if you can help it. Adoo, dear B. They all sends
their loves.</p>

<p>P.S.&mdash;You write sometimes about the Niggers, and abuse

here; for my couzen told me that the Blacks had got all his
beans&mdash;I only gives this as an int.</p>

NEWS FROM HASTINGS.</h3>

<p class="center smcap">To John Bull.</p>

<p class="right small">Hastings, Aug. 4, 1828.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dear B.</span>,&mdash;It is all over&mdash;Lavy is as well as can be expected&mdash;she
was put to bed with a gull, which sadly disappointed
Fulmer, who was very desirous of having a sun and
air. We have had another burth in our family, of which I
says nothing&mdash;the dennymang of that fox paw<a name="FNanchor_16" id="FNanchor_16"></a><a href="#Footnote_16" class="fnanchor">[16]</a> has been uncommon
unpleasant; however, when such things happen to
females, they must grin and bear them, as the saying goes.</p>

<p>We have found out who our old bow is: he is the Count
Narly, a French mounsheer of high rank, and acquainted
with Prince Pickle and Mustard, the gentleman who was at
the haughtycultural breakfast with Mrs. Wise, the day she
was so silly as to try to drown herself in a bason&mdash;if it had
not been that one of the Human Society had picked her up,
she must have been a lost cretur&mdash;Fulmer calls her a diving
bell, but I'm sure I don't know why.</p>

<p>Count Narly is very conversible, only he talks all in French&mdash;Fulmer
says that he is too much of a hegoatist, and that
all his nannygoats are about himself. He is acquainted with
Mr. Brunel, who has put his toenail under the river Thames,
who has asked him to visit him in London.</p>

<p>I was very glad to see some partitions in Parlyment against
sutties&mdash;the sooner they does away with the poor little
climbing boys the better&mdash;no wonder they burn themselves
sometimes&mdash;and I see it is just the same in Hingy, although
one wouldn't think they wanted fires there.</p>

<p>As soon as ever Lavy gets about we are going to Brighton
to drink the water, which some gentlemen there makes for the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[95]</a></span>
use of inphalids&mdash;it is uncommon curious how they do it;
but I'm told that you may get there the Side-shoots and the
Side-lights, and the Carls bad water, (I don't know if they
have any of that sort, good,) and the Spawn water, and the
Arrowgate, and Matchlock, and Hems, and Gentleman salts;
indeed, any sort you like to ask for&mdash;however, I don't think
I shall like Brighton much in this summer wether, they tell
me there are so many flies about. The 10th Huzzas are also
there, which I want very much to see&mdash;the foot regimen is
moved from there, in consequence, I suppose, of the quarrel
between our King and Don M'cgill, and, from all I can make
out of it, a very silly quarrel it is. Last year or so we were
all going to loggerheads because one man liked Turkey better
than Grease, and now we are to have a blow up because they
cannot decide whether Port or Madeira should be opened
first&mdash;I have no patience with such stuff. I think if folks are
to quarrell, women is a better thing to quarrell about than
wine, and so the Autograph of Russia and the Grand Senior
think, for they, I see, are fighting about two of the fair
secks, Bess Harabia, and Moll Davy.</p>

<p>There has been some dreadful wether here; the other
evening, as I was sitting at my twilight, preparing to go to
bed, the eclectic fluid looked quite awful, and the winds blowd
tremendous; indeed the raging of the elephants was terrific;
two gentlemen were upset in a boat, and obleeged to swim
ashore in their He-meeses; at least that is what I supposes
French for shirts, because what the ladies wear they call
She-meeses; however, such has been the reign that it has
come down in Torrens, and if our Bows had not provided
themselves with Duck Trousers and Pumps, I don't know
what they would have done.</p>

<p>The Secretairer of the Treasury is down here; he lives by
Fire-light in this nayborhood&mdash;I suppose he come from the
West Hinges, for they tell me he is a Planter as well as a
Hempee, which Fulmer says he is.</p>

<p>I have heard a new comehumdrum, which is a very fashion<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[96]</a></span>able
amusement here&mdash;"Why is the gravy of a leg of pork
the best gravy in the world?"&mdash;"Because there's no Jews
like it." I do not know where the joke is, only I spose there
is one. I have hardly any thing to say, only I thought you
would like to hear of Lavy's acoachman, and our prospect of
removal from this place, which is not at all to my gout.</p>

MRS. RAMSBOTTOM GIVES HER OPINION OF THE
RELATIVE MERITS OF MARGATE AND BRIGHTON.</h3>

<p class="center smcap">To John Bull.</p>

<p class="right small">Oct. 1828.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">My dear B.</span>,&mdash;We are at length arrived in the subbubs of
London. Since crowds of people have been collected at
the Traitor's and Restorers in Regent-street, I am afraid to
date this, lest the folks should come to look at us&mdash;but you
can easily find out the redress at Fulmer's hothell.</p>

<p>We came last from Margate, which to my mind is far
prefferible to Briton. At Briton you have always the great
bright sparkling Ossian surfeiting the jingle from morning
till night, enough to put one's eyes out, and drive one deaf&mdash;at
Margate there is a beautiful arbour, in which there is
no water whatsomever for twelve hours out of every twenty-four,
which affords the curos observer a full view of Ossian's
bottom: besides, instead of nasty hard jingle and stones, it
is all beautiful blue mud, the sight of which, added to the
smell of the juice from the gash works above, reminds one
of the dear Mephistopholis, to the neighbourhood of which
we have returned.</p>

<p>Then the Peer at Margate is quite a different thing from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[97]</a></span>
the jigumaree, swing swang, jinkum linkum thing at Briton.
At Margate it is all fixed&mdash;built of white stone, and painted
pee-green on the inside, which makes it look quite beautiful;
besides, at Briton you see nothing partiklur on the Chain-peer
but the sea, and the company, and the clifts, and the
vessels; but at Margate, besides all the predestinarians a
walking, you have stage coaches, flies, waggons, cars, and
sociables, ready to take you all over the country, not to
speak of carts a fetching coals out of the arbour, and men
at the Jetty a bringing in fish alive out of the sea.</p>

<p>The Marine Libray, at Margate, is a beautiful building,
with two windows in front, and a wooden gallery at the back
of the shop, over the mud&mdash;there's nothing in Briton to
equal that&mdash;and as to the King's statute, by Shantry, what
is it to the beautiful image of Nipchune, the great sea god,
<ins class="corr" title="Transcriber's Note&mdash;Original text: 'n black'">in black</ins>, nailed up again the gable end of the marine, just
a going to spear an eel as natural as life. Then the streets&mdash;snug
and comfortable&mdash;none of your great straggling prades
or esplanades&mdash;no&mdash;pleasant retreats, where opposite neighbours
can shake hands without leaving their rooms&mdash;this is
quite agreeable; it is always shady, and besides, it creates
an intrust, as Mr. Fulmer says, when strolling along a street
not to know on which side of the way one is walking.</p>

<p>The church here is beautiful&mdash;not like Briton, stuck down
in a vally; it is up on the top of the hil, so that one is
half way to heaven before one is a quarter of the way to the
church; howsumever, the Galls can see it from Callous if
they look sharp, that's one thing. The stone it is made of,
is got out of the bath.</p>

<p>The great hotel at Margate is called House, and is situated
in Chisel-square&mdash;a most splendid hairy, something like
Salsbury-square in Fleet-street, only not quite so munificent;
here they have luckily succeeded in getting rid of the sea
altogether; indeed they have been very fortunate in their
attempts in many other places. One of my neices is agoing
to open a semenary here, in which I hope she will suckseed;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[98]</a></span>
at present she has several pupils in her eye&mdash;at least she
tells <em>me</em> so, but Mr. Fulmer says she can have but one&mdash;so
I suppose she phibbs.</p>

<p>The baths here are uncommon agreeable; they are not
like the baths at Briton, great staring houses, but nice little
low rooms, like the cabins of packets, with a railed place
behind where you wait till the water comes in to the
arbour, of which I spoke before; but it is not there always
punctual at the same time, which is a grate boar; to be sure
the ships does lie nice and easy with their bottoms in the
mud, and the sailors quite quiet aboard, with all their cabals
on the shore. Some very spirted gentleman has dug some
baths out of the cliff, with a music room under ground quite
subtraining, with a way for the donkies to go down to it,
without stares; the view of Ossian from a hole cut in the
chork is very rheumatic: Fulmer says the digging them
holes is a very wise way of sinking a capital. I hope it
will anser.</p>

<p>At Briton the grate libray used to be kept by Donald's son,
whoever he was; the grate libray at Margate is kept by
Betty's son, whoever <em>she</em> is, for they dont tell us their sirnames;
it is a large room, quite snug and away from the
sea, in a square called Horley&mdash;very different from Hawley
on the way to Briton. At <em>that</em> Hawley Mr. Pickhisnails keeps
the hin, has a fine booshy head of air, sleeps in top boots,
and paints the stems of his trees sky blew for huniformity's
sake. In the Horley-square at Margate, there are, besides
Betty's sons, some uncommon nice boring houses, where
a lady can live genteel and comfortable, without washing,
for a jenny and a half a week.</p>

<p>Onion Crescent is near this, and is reckoned very pleasant,
and so it is. There is no glare in Margate, to hurt the eyes.
The houses look always upon the bax of others, which keeps
away the son in summer, and the wind in winter. I know
at Briton we was very much troubled with the wind when we
lived on the Marrying Prade&mdash;at Margate it is quite different.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[99]</a></span></p>

<p>Fulmer, who is what is called a geehologist, says there
is much amusement to be found amongst the Clifts. He
talks of finding his sisters and taking his quarts, of which I
never heard him speak afore, and he told us the other day
that he had dug up some bedlamites. What he has done
with them I dont know. The things he shewed me were, I
believe, only their finger nails&mdash;they looked just like it.</p>

<p>With respect to the bathing, it is much more descent than
at Briton, for the machines here have yawnings over them,
by which means nobody can see one, however much they
looks. We went to visit Dandelion, once a public garden.
They say the place took its name from a lion's tooth; I'm
sure I have heard something very unlike <em>that</em>, if it is what
<em>I</em> mean.</p>

<p>We came away from this trestial parodice in the <i>Harlequin</i>
steamer, and a large party we was: it was uncommon agreeable,
only there was what is called a swell, which did not
agree with the buttered toast, red herrings, honey, eggs, and
tea, which we tuck as a remedy agin sickness. Mr. Fulmer
said we had rolls as well as tost for breakfast, which made a
thin gentleman in a white hat, which sot oposite us, laugh
very much.</p>

<p>I did not go upon dick after heaten, but I heard them talk
of seeing a great many boys about in the water; one was a
boy with a horse, and another a boy with the bacon on his
head. One of the first they saw, they said was the last,
which seemed nonsense to me. However, they said there
was several Spaniards a swimming near the pacquet, so I
would not let my young ones go up.</p>

<p>To be sure, what phibbs travellers do tell&mdash;we was a talking
of the great exhibition of the gurney to London by steam,
when a gentleman told us, looking as grave as a gudge, that
he and his father had made the Rickulvers in an hour and a
quarter, after leaving the Noah light that day week: of course
I said nothing&mdash;but I was certain as I was of being alive and
living, that neither the gentleman nor his father had anything<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[100]</a></span>
to do with making the Rickulvers, which I myself saw three
and twenty years ago&mdash;and to make them in an hour and a
quarter! However, everybody seemed to believe him&mdash;I
only asked what profession he was of, and they told me he
was imminent in the Tayloring line. That settled it&mdash;"Two
tailors," as the French says&mdash;the very highdea of their talking
of making the Rickulvers just as they would a pair of
pantaloons&mdash;and them they could not make in an hour and a
quarter, binding, button-holes and all, I'm sure.</p>

<p>When we got into smooth water, I went upstairs to see
Noah's light, and there I saw the ark, with the lantern, and
I believe Noah himself a walking up and down the dick. I
asked one of the sailors if the men which was walking was
never changed, and he said, every four hours; but that the
man we saw, had been there ever since the flood&mdash;which
convinced me. We saw from this, Sheerness with a
river, which is Midway between Margate and town, and is
called so.</p>

<p>I was very glad when the water was smooth, for I hate the
big bellows a rolin, and so I told the gentleman in the airy cap
which turns the wheel about&mdash;and he said we should have
found it much ruffer if we had not come overland. This
puzzled me, because I thought we was coming by sea all the
time I was below, it bumped me about so&mdash;but he persisted
in what he said, and moreover said something very disrespectful
of the people of the place we had left, which he
called the Margate flats. Everything seemed to clear up as
we proceeded; we had Lee church on our wether bow, as
the gentleman told me&mdash;the waters were called Hopes, and
the sands were blithe&mdash;and we was all golly and uncommon
hungary&mdash;so down we went to wait till the dinner came,
which was some nice bile mutton and turnips with caper
sauce, which occupied me all the way from a little above
Tilbury Furt to Erin, which looks just as green as Mr.
More, the pote, says it is.</p>

<p>At Gravesend we took in a gentleman, who gave us an<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[101]</a></span>
account of the Grand Signior having sent out a fireman
against the Roosians, which was a gettin beat by the Turkeys&mdash;however,
as we was to go ashore at Grinnage, we had no
time for pollyticks, having in course to look up the bundles
and ban-boxes. Lavy went by land, on account of her child,
and her misfortunes was greater than ores, for she left her
black silk riddykel in the coch, containing the best part of a
bottle of O de Goalong, a salmon-coloured neck handkycher,
and a pair of nice yellow tan gloves&mdash;her brother went all
the way to the Bare coach office in Pickadilly the next morning,
but could hear no tidings on 'em.</p>

<p>When we come opposite the Horsespittle at Grinnage, we
got into a boat and landed just by the Ship, which smelt of
frying fish as ousel. I think if I had not committed an
indiscretion with the bile leg of mutton, we should have been
tempted to stop and have some stoodells and whatasujet&mdash;as
it was, we got into our domstic, a carriage so called, and
proceeded by Peckham and Cammerwell home.</p>

<p>I shall write again soon.&mdash;I am to be presented to the Quin
of Portingal&mdash;the Countess of Itabagpipes was known to
some of Fulmer's cousins in the brass heel country, which is
the reason she wishes me to lend her my counting-house and
purtection; so, one day next week I shall go in by the
Stockwell stage, and visit the Court in Arlington-street. As
for Jennyfluxion, I hope her Majesty will excuse me, for
though poor Chunee, I remember, used to do it at Exeter
Change, if I was once to get down upon my kneeses I am
quite sure I never could git up again&mdash;but I shall communicate
in a private billy with Lady Bagpipes on the subject.</p>

<p>Lavy desires her best love&mdash;Fulmer is as proud as a Pig-hog
of his little gull, and my unmarried ones quite as unspohastickated
as ever&mdash;there <em>was</em> a gentleman at Margate did
give the youngest a sort of tittilation of the heart, and she
had only two helps of beef and one plate of soup at dinner
for three days in consequence of her tinder felings, but he
went off in the <i>Ramona</i> the morning it carried passengers<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[102]</a></span>
greatass, and so did my girl's infection for him, and the next
day she sung "I've been roaming," and took to her vitals
just as if nothing had happened.&mdash;Adjou.</p>

MRS. RAMSBOTTOM CONTEMPLATES THE COLLECTION
OF HER LETTERS INTO A VOLUME.</h3>

<p class="center smcap">To John Bull.</p>

<p class="right small">January 25, 1829.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dear B.</span>,&mdash;I write to you on a bizziness of some consequence
to me&mdash;I have been applied to by some of the first
jenny asses of the day to colic my lettuce into one volume,
and publish them: so I spoke to my sun in law Fulmer, who
has offered to hedit them, and put notes to them, which I at
first thought meant setting them to mewsick, which I by no
means wanted, although he offered to do it grateass. He has
now explained his meanun, and I am going to get Mr. Golburn
to print them in a doodecimus book, with a prefass and
portrait, to be done from a Minotaur by Causeway, which is
reckoned the himmige of me when I was a gull, and for wich
Mr. Ram. paid Mr. Causeway, (quite a Minotaur of a man
himself,) fifty jinnies.</p>

<p>You know I never rot to anybody but you, although some
impotent parsons have dared to call themselves the hawthurs
of my lettus. There is one of them squarecap fellows
belonging to the Magdalen at Hauksfut&mdash;which they say
lives upon Ices&mdash;he says he rot some of them, and one at
Eating College says <em>he</em> helped me, and another, a bare blockhead
whose name I never heard afore, goes about and says
<em>he</em> rot 'em for me. He had better mind his tye pigs, and
adjustments, and dews and surplices, I can tell him, for all<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[103]</a></span>
his tong runs so glebe; for I never sot eye on him, nor he
on me, as I nose of&mdash;however, I am dissolved upon publishing
them out and out. Mr. Golburn wants them to come out
in sheets, but I dont think that quite <em>come ill fo</em>.</p>

<p>There is a moneyment of two old gentlemen who were my
Aunt's sisters, in a church in Lincumshire, done by Mr. Ruebellyache
the great Sculpture, which was admired by the late
Mr. Noddlecums, whose life has been published by his
Taylor, and which cuts him up, sure enough&mdash;I should like
to have the view of this family Muzzleheum in the book, if I
could get it done in the new fashioned style of Lithotomy,
because it shoes all the harms of our family, Lions sergeants,
and the Lions parsons, and the Lions ramping, with the shiverings
and mullets, and argents, and oars, and sables, and
gulls, and all that, which we bore ever since William the
Conqueror came over with Quin Mary, of hoom, no doubt,
you have read.</p>

<p>My Mr. Ramsbottom's family, although very good, is not
connected with that of the Hempee for Winsor, which family
is eyely respectable in their whey, and quite sillybratted for
bruin the bear, wich is so patternized in the neighbrood.
Mr. Fulmer says, my dear Mr. Ram is quite a different ramification,
but he thinks if you would just reckumend us to the
Biblepole (I think he calls Mr. Goulburn) he could make
three volums out of my letters, what letters I have received,
his own notes, and all the notes the gals has got by way of
orthographs, and a dairy, which my dear Mr. Ram kept till
the day before he did.</p>

<p>I took my two eldest unmarried, the other day, to Mr.
Devil's in the Strand, to be felt&mdash;they call him Mr. De Feel,
but he spells it Deville, and calls <em>himself</em> Mr. De Huile&mdash;he
is a Hoyl-man and a great proffessor of what is called <em>Free-knowledgey</em><a name="FNanchor_17" id="FNanchor_17"></a><a href="#Footnote_17" class="fnanchor">[17]</a>&mdash;he
shewed us the head of Sterne, which wrote
many books, and also that of Sir Eyes-ache Newton, the
great astrologer&mdash;he says I have the largest number one he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[104]</a></span>
ever saw, and when I cum away he sneered, and bid me take
care of number one, as if everybody didn't do that without <em>his</em>
telling.&mdash;He wanted to put a plaster on my head, and smear
my face with some of his lampile, and stick squills up my
nose, and take what he called a cast of my Hosfrontis&mdash;but
I would not have none of his manoovers with me, and I was
very well pleased when I found myself out of the shop.</p>

<p>Only think, Mr. B., of Lord Angelseye coming home&mdash;he
is left tenant of the castle no longer. Mr. Fulmer says he is
like a hair which gives up doubling when it takes to turning.
I am quite sorry to think what a state he must be in. Miss
Biffin, or Billy Bowldish, the corpulent gentleman who used
to bump himself along the streets in a band-box, an't nothing
to compare with him. His Lordship told the people of
Ireland that he had left his <em>heart</em> with <em>them</em>. Fulmer says,
before he said <em>that</em>, he must have lost his <em>head</em>, and I seed
one of his <em>legs</em> buried at Whataloo&mdash;of course, after that, the
only thing left for him was to pack up his <em>trunk</em>, and come
home; but pollyticks I seldom tuches, only I <em>does</em> like plain
dealing.</p>

<p>Will you please to let me here from you, for you are a sad
idol corryspondent&mdash;you promises to rite, and never dus,
which is very disapinting. However, you must rite to give
us leaf to print the Ramsbottom Papers, which has been
redressed to you&mdash;give me your opinion about the minotaur
and the muzzleum, and believe me, dear B.,</p>

MRS. RAMSBOTTOM'S OPINIONS ON POPERY.</h3>

<p class="center smcap">To John Bull.</p>

<p class="right small">Gravesend, April 2, 1829.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">My dear B.</span>,&mdash;I have taken a trumpery residence hear for
the seeson for the health of my therd gull, which is frequently
effected with a goose. I send you up a copy of the Gravesend
Guide, which will explain all the booty of the place, and
all its convenences; the passage in the steemboat is cheap
and agreble, and we run up and down every two or three
tims in the weak.</p>

<p>Oh, B. B., I have got a krow to plock with you&mdash;I cannot
make out what makes you such a stench Protestant; poor
dear Mr. Ram never could bear Poppery, but I am afraid he
was a biggoat at bottom, for the mounsheer which marred my
second, tells me that it is a sweat religion, and that you can
always get ablution for paying for it&mdash;which is very pleasant.</p>

<p>I remember the riots of Hayti, when they burnt old Newgate
and got to all the goals; they raised several houses to
the groand, and burned Lord Mansfield's house in Bloomsbury-square,
which was of brick and stone; what would
they have done with his Willy up at Highgate, which is all
made of Cane-wood; yet after all these I see he goes on in
the Hose of Pears a speeking agin the Roming Catlicks just
as if nothin had happened to him; he must be very antickated
now I shoud think.</p>

<p>You have heard, in course, that the new Pop is erected.
Mounsheer tells me that Ginger was a very good Pop as ever
was&mdash;he died notwithstanding his infallowbility&mdash;all Pops go
off&mdash;and that's as it should be, for as they lives infallowbill
so they infallowbelly dies. Mounsheer told me that it was
thought that either Carnal Fetch or Carnal Comealongo would<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[106]</a></span>
have been erected Pop, but that Charles Deece would have
put his Feeto upon Fetch, so they have erected Castellioneye&mdash;they
put poor Ginger after his deth into a cistern, with his
holy toes a protruding out of a grating for the people to kiss.</p>

<p>I should have liked to be in Room when the concave was
held. Oh Mr. B. you very much mistake the Catlick Priesthood.
All the stories you hear of the Carnals keeping
columbines is entirely calomel&mdash;they nose better than to do
such things as those&mdash;for my part, I hop to see the day when
all extinction of religion is forgot, and we shall see all our
halters occupied by Popish Priests. What does Mr. More,
the allmyknack maker, say on this toepick&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<p class="verseq">"Shall I ask the brave soger what fites by my side,</p>
<p class="verse4">In the kaws of mankind if our creeds agree?</p>
<p class="verse">Shall I give up the friend I have vallied and tried,</p>
<p class="verse4">If he kneel not afore the same halter with me?</p>
<p class="verse">From the hairytick gull of my sole shall I fly,</p>
<p class="verse4">To seek somewhere's else a more authordox kiss?</p>
<p class="verse">No&mdash;perish the harts and the laws as try,</p>
<p class="verse4">Truth, walour, and love, by a standurd like this."</p>
</div></div></div>

<p>I says ditto, ditto, to Mister More; why should we Hairyticks
stick up for our authordoxies, or any other sich, or despise
the Roming Catlicks&mdash;why, we are decanters from
the holy church ourselves, just as much as the Sauceinions
and the Hairyuns,<a name="FNanchor_18" id="FNanchor_18"></a><a href="#Footnote_18" class="fnanchor">[18]</a> and the Whistlings, or any others, are
from hours&mdash;can't we wusship, every one after his own
fashion&mdash;look at the Quackers&mdash;there's a sex, so pyehouse,
and demure, and desunt, in everything good and propper.</p>

<p>Why, do <em>you</em> know, Mr. B., the Quacker ladies goes down
to Grinnage, and Woolidge, and Popular, and the Isle of
Docks, and all them parts, to phissit the poor feemale convix,
which is about to be transpirted to Von Demons Land and
Bottomy bay, where the illustrus Cook first found out the
Cangarews&mdash;poor gulls, I think it a pitty to send out the
pretty Lassenies, they are some on 'em so juvenal. Oh,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[107]</a></span>
Muster B., what must their Rum and essences be when they
reclects Tim past&mdash;some on 'em if they are hard working
meretricious gulls, get marred as soon as they gets to the
Coloony, and when they does, Mr. Fulmer tells me they
play the very dooce with the Malt house system, which I
spose means that they drink too much hail, and bear in
proporshun.</p>

<p>A navel sergeant goes to take care on 'em, and see as they
wants for no thing&mdash;he locks them up every night, and never
suffers no <em>Foxes paws</em>, but keeps them quite creckt, and they
are in sich order that he has only just to talk of the lock and
the key to subdoo e'm in a minuet&mdash;poor creturs, them as I
seed where chairful, and not one of them was wiping, they
had plenty of vitals, and spoke of the Coloony as a nice
place, and called the Guvenor a Darling&mdash;but it seems
wretched work&mdash;to hope for happiness there, is to follow an
English Fattyus, which you know is a Will of the Whips,
which is seed in the mashes.</p>

<p>But anuff of this&mdash;rite me word what you think of the
Hopra&mdash;I think Pisarowneye is a bootiful singer&mdash;I dont
much like Specky, and as for Mountijelly she harn't got no
vice&mdash;not what I call a sweet vice&mdash;Miss Blazes is harmonias,
but I see by the bills that they have denounced an Angel and
a Devil to act, which I do not think <em>come il pho</em>. I have not
seen Suck Kelly, nor Bellygreeny, but I recleck Mollybrown
Garshia quite well. The new ballad of Mass and Kneelo is
quite splendead&mdash;there is a him to the Vergin, sung just like
Tedium in a church, and Wesuewius in the rear is quite
tremendos. Colonel O'Conner said he never saw a more
beautiful crater in all his born days, and he is quite a jug of
those matters.</p>

<p><em>Haprowpow dee Botts</em>&mdash;Why do you satyreyes my friends
Lethbridge and Fillpott&mdash;you give a whole chapter to the
Dean every Sunday which is too much, and as for calling
Sir Tomass a rat, I deny the fack&mdash;at least if he <em>is</em> a rat, the
day I saw him at dinner with Lord Wenerables he must have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[108]</a></span>
twisted his tail into the bag behind him, for I saw none
of it.</p>

<p>I have no noose, except that we all wish you would come
and explode these parts&mdash;perhaps you will, after you have
red the guide. The passage is short and iconumical, only
two shillings by the steam bot, or as the French call it, the
<em>pack bot avec peur</em>. Do come&mdash;we all unite in best regards.</p>

MRS. RAMSBOTTOM AT THE ROYAL ACADEMY.</h3>

<p class="right small">May, 1829.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dear B.</span>,&mdash;As you haven't given any count of the Summerset
House expedition, which opened as weasal, the fust
Monday in May, I thoght perhaps a few loose remarks of
mine and Lavy's would be exceptable, therefore I rite to give
you an int of what <em>we</em> think.</p>

<p>Oh, that Precedent, Sir Tummas Larrence&mdash;I never seed
such pitchers as his&mdash;but I need not talk of those, because
you nose his merits&mdash;what I want is, to bring to your notice
some of the young uns.</p>

<p>Well, B., away we went Wensday, and paid our munney
at the dore, and the man gave us a chick, and we bought
our catlog, and then another man tuck away my parisot,
which never happened to me before, the many ears I have
seen in that place&mdash;he told me if I gave him my one, he
would give me a number&mdash;which deseived me, so I let him
have it, and he gave me a curd&mdash;this was just at the bottom
of the great Achilles with the fir knees wich is kept in a bird
cage, to prevent the people hurting his back&mdash;well, up we<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[109]</a></span>
went&mdash;such a stare case&mdash;so hot was I&mdash;however, at last up
we got.</p>

<p>The fust pitcher I seed was Adam and Heve expulsed from
Paradise, by Debuffe. In buff I think&mdash;I never seed such a
thing in all my days, and no reason for it, because it was after
the date of the fig leaves&mdash;no matter&mdash;I turned away my eyes
to Doctor Gobbleston, the Bishop of Llandaff, and a plainer
creatur I never set my eyes on&mdash;his face looks for all the
world as if he had been a rat hunting up a chimley. I
couldn't look at him long. The next I saw was "I. Strutt,
Esqueer, and his sister." I'm sure that is a likeness; and
the next is called "a Gentleman," which I am sure can<em>not</em> be
a likeness.</p>

<p>Lord Caravan, with a sword on, is a fine work, and so is a
big picture of a Hero going to Philander in the Tower; and
near that is one of a Gull with a Guttar, with sich funny
pudsy fingers, which made Lavy laugh so as I was quite
ashammed of her. Then there is one by Mr. Willes of
a Dream, where "Puck takes away an asses head from
bottom,"&mdash;it is so in the catlog, and I wonder at it&mdash;but no
matter&mdash;I'm sure I felt quite in jeffery when I read such a
thing in a book&mdash;and Mr. Newton, my favourite, what drawed
the Disconsolate Lady in white satan, which hided her head
in her hankycher, at the British Gallary, has got the pitcher
of a Lady in a Coach-horse Dress, uncommon pretty; and
Mr. Picksgill has got Sir Jeffery Dunstan with his gray locks
a dangling just as I remember him when he was Mare of
Garret, only bigger.</p>

<p>An artist of the name of Bedstead has a picture of two
whole Snips, and also of two Jack Snips&mdash;which is meant for
birds, but I never heard of sich afore. There is also Sir Roger
de Coverlee and the Gypsums, and a picture of Lord Drum,
(Lampton as was,) by Larrence, like as to phechurs, but not
his compleckshun. I wish my Lord had sot to Turner, he
would have done him betterer.</p>

<p>Mr. Barraud has a pitcher of his own painting, which he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[110]</a></span>
calls the Study of an Ass&mdash;how funny!&mdash;and there is Miss
Phillips of Drury-lane, with a long waste, and no more like
her pretty face than I am like her&mdash;instead of Dawe after
this pitcher they should have put Dawb. Mr. Landseer has
got a picture of a dead oh dear, and there is a pitcher of
Colonel Johnson, who is called the Cove of Mustcat.</p>

<p>No. 241 is a pitcher of Zebuses and Quaggas, so like you
cannot think; and another of the Bishop of Rochester&mdash;such
a dandy&mdash;smirking and smooth faced, with a fancy wig&mdash;not
a bit of the regelation cut about it&mdash;but no matter&mdash;he was
only the Bishop of Soda the other day&mdash;Family made the
Mann, and ratting made the Bishop.</p>

<p>There is a french pitcher of crowning a dead body, and a
gentleman what is a King, with white stays and a blue walking-stick,
a watching on it; and there is a Mr. Luck, secretairer
to the London Institution, which is either a piece of
bad luck or a bad likeness. In the Antick Acadamme there
are two pitchers which are worth looking at&mdash;one, <em>Baron
Carl Ashating von Triggum</em>, and the other <em>Major Von de
Roggery Sue Peppercorn</em>. I loves 'em for their names. Mr.
Smith exhibits some specie of Cactus from natur, which of
course I did not look at&mdash;and No. 576 is the portrait of a
Colonel, so like a horse, that if you was not told it was a
military officer you never would find it out.</p>

<p>I cannot go all through the catlog&mdash;in the model-room,
there is the head of a Rabbit, so like an old closeman that I
never should have taken it for the little hannimal what hops
about; and a buteful busk of Lady Elizabeth Gower, which
was the only thing I saw I should like to have had&mdash;unless,
indeed, it was the great Chanticleer which hangs in the top
room, which the King gave the Acadammee; however, I
should have staid longer, but a poor gentleman, a stout lustful
man, slipped down the stares just as we was looking about,
and broke his leg, so bad that we heard he suffered an imputation
the same night&mdash;this quite shocked Lavy, who has a
feline disposition, and can't bear to see any thing hurt&mdash;so<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[111]</a></span>
we came home; but I shall go again, and perhaps rite you
some more of my observashuns.&mdash;Yours ever,</p>

MRS. RAMSBOTTOM AT THE "CHISWICK FÊTE."</h3>

<p class="center smcap">To John Bull.</p>

<p class="right small">July, 1829.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">My dear B.</span>,&mdash;We was all at the wet feet at Chissick on
Saturday; Lavy and Fulmer, and Mounsheer, my second,
and the two "june dimiselles," as Mounsheer calls them;
and sich a site as that for a breakfast, never did I clap my
too eyes on&mdash;furst of all, we went off in Fulmer's broach
and Mounsheer's brisket&mdash;all in the poring rein&mdash;two cargoes
of us, and we was literally socked through and
through afore we got there, and there was a great poodle
under the place where I sot; however, we had paid our jennies,
and we was determined to have a reseat in fool.</p>

<p>But now I must tell you before I begin, that when we
got home, Fulmer sot down just like Swalter Scott, or
Milton, or Pop, or any one of the potes, and rot a whole
account of it in verse, every bit of it as true as if it warn't
pottery at all, and then he sung it to us, Lavy playing the
Pein forte accompaniment; and when I asked him to give it
me for you, he tore it all to hattams. But I matched him
there, as I had done afore. As soon as he was gone out of
the room I picked up the pieces (which, if I had not a
watched him, I think he would have gone and done himself);
and so I stuck the paper together as well as I cood, but
some of the virses is still missing: however, wherever there
is a ole in the ballad I will supply the place with my pros,
so as to make it a jint produxion just like Bowman and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[112]</a></span>

<p>Then there's a verse wanton, which of course I can't remember;
but the Bow-street officers were all round the dore,
and they looked to me as little like Bows as they did like
officers; however, there was a large poodle to get over, and
I heard them bid me wait till they sent for a Plank,
which turned out to be a humane cretur, the head of the
Pelisse. We had no umberellars, only our parisoles; but we
got into a long tent, and there Fulmer told me I had better
make my election to stay, because I was favoured both by
the canvas and the pole; which I do not understand, but he
put it all in rhyme about a "hujus encampment," something
you know, I don't quite remember, to "keep off the
damp meant;" and then he praised the bootiful cretures
what was a setting in the mud under the yawning, which
cood not get out, and called them the most elegant flowers
and fruits of the day.</p>

<p>It was no good a stopping ther however, for we was a
mile a'most from the feeding place which Mr. Grunter
had prepared for his fellow-creturs; so I determined wet or
dry, nolus bolus, over I would go&mdash;it was uncommon squashy,
and poor Lavy had a touch of the Room attics in her head
before we come out, however it warnt no use complaining,
so the two Hauls, which was phissitors of ours, and I, ondertook
to cross over the plot&mdash;of that, Fulmer says&mdash;</p>

<p>Here there is another ole, and I think it must be a herror
of the arthurs, because "cold meat and dripping" is
nonsense; however, no matter, we got over, and <em>there</em>, if
you'll believe me, was a matter of a kipple of thousand
humane creturs, just like pigs with their noses in the troffs,
agin the wall, a heating and a heating, and a grunting and a
grumbling, over their uncles in gravelly mud.</p>

<p>I heard one man ask for a kennel of chicken, and another
wanted a blanket of veel; but the master cock pot his head
out of a French marqui, and said there warnt nothing shew
(which, as you know, means hot, in the language of the Galls);
so I squeedged out three young youths and two gulls which
was a making themselves sick with eating isis, and made
rheum for myself, and sot too to make up my jennys worth;
but if you'll believe me, dear B. (I didn't care for the muck
I was a standing in, for I had a cork soul,) but presently I
felt drip, drip, drip, something a dripping into my neck
behind, which I was so ot a crossing the grace plot I
didn't feel at first, but which was the rein a coming through
the callyko top of the yawning; and what was uncommon
surprising to me, although the clouts above were so black,
yet the rein which fell, cum down quite blue. I had a glass
of Bucephalus, three big glasses of celery Shimpain (which
shews the advantage of the garden, for it was just as good as
any made from grapes) and a small glass of O. D. V.,
which the master cock in his white nite cap sent out to me.
Fulmer called the people who got under cover, the <em>con-tents</em>,
and them as could not, the <em>non con-tents</em>.</p>

<p>But if you had seen the way in which the genteelmen run
about to fetch vitals for the ladies&mdash;it was quite charming.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[115]</a></span>
"I want a wing for a lady," says one&mdash;"I want a couple of
legs for my ant, who can't walk," says another&mdash;"A thick
slice of beef for Miss Angelina," and so on. Oh! it was
quite delightful, only I don't think so double refined as I
expected for a jenny. Fulmer says, in a verse about the
company&mdash;</p>

<p>However one accident happened&mdash;somethink always does
happen wherever we go. My second was beautifully dressed&mdash;all
after one of the Magaseens, and quite unlike any body
else&mdash;and somehow or other&mdash;I dont know whether it was
the whet or what&mdash;but part of her close tumbled off; however
the Bows which was about thought it was one of her
sleeves, and nobody cared except her husband Mounsheer,
who was quite in a bustle at loosing anything, and <em>would</em>
make her tell him all about it, because he was terrified at
seeing her so very much reduced in figger in so short a space
of time&mdash;Mounsheer got it back from one of the Artillery
Bumbardeers which was in the garden to watch the river for
fear it should get dry&mdash;howsoever there was plenty of water
this time.</p>

<p>Well, B., after we had eat in four places, and tried for the
fifth, but could get nothing but the bottoms of Hams, which
Fulmer twisted into "Hamsbottoms," and made it rhyme to
my name, we went out just for a minuet, thinking the rein
had sopsided; but we had scarce got out of the heating place<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[116]</a></span>
when down it come agin, and we was obliged to run for it&mdash;(I
don't run very expedishus at any time, much less after
what I had eat)&mdash;and got into what is called the committee-room,
a place as dark as pitch, and smelling like a seed shop;
indeed I never seed such a place in my life; and there was
the Tyrrelease Pheasants, and sich a silly gull a asking them
all manner of foolish questions about their singeing their
Tyrrellease kitches or whatever they are. This warn't lost
upon Fulmer&mdash;and I have preserved that virse&mdash;</p>

<p>Well, B., and after that, I am sorry to say when it got to
hold up for a minuet again, the Bows, which I thought had
been a carrion the Shimpain and the vitals to the ladies,
shewed by their conduct that they had only got the things in
the names of the fair sects, and as Fulmer said had added
to the frauds of the neutral flags, by taking to themselves,
under false pretences, what was shipped for other people&mdash;they
was quite inhebriated, and played very improper
pranks&mdash;Fulmer said, that he himself saw one lady play
<em>Merry tricks</em>, but if so, I dare say she'll try <em>new tricks</em> before
she comes there again&mdash;however, the conduct of the men was
quite obstropolous, and one of them spoke to my seckond as
if he had been introdeuced, and when he asked her name,
and she said Ramsbottom, he behaved more imperently than
he had done before, and said that he had noed us all long
ago. I'm sure he never noed me, nor none of my daughters,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[117]</a></span>
and so I told him, and I begged Mr. Fulmer to find out the
Secrethairy, Mr. Sabine, to come and speak to the imperent
poppy; but Fulmer told me that we had better go away as
fast as we could, for that when men were in <em>that</em> state none
of the Sabines would be safe; so of course I would not go
to hinger a respectable family, and we got over our uncles to
the gate, where we found our servant Jenkins in the custardy
of the offisers, for nocking down a beetle belonging to the
gardner, which would not let him poke his knows in to look
for us. So Fulmer did, (what, considering the weather, was
quite necessary,) gave his curd to the pelisseman, and baled
out the footman.</p>

<p>But I must say a Jew, and I cannot help thinkin how
surprized Fulmer will be when he sees your pepper in the
mornun. Lavy has been in bed ever since the Feet; our
cousin Kate has got a swelled face; the Hauls have both got
bad coughs, and Mounsheer and his wife have been takin
teasannes every nite and morning; however, I hope we shall
soon get about, and if what I have saved out of the phier is
of any use, you are welkum.&mdash;Yours, dear B., always,</p>

ought to know beast.</p>

A PECK OF TROUBLES.</h3>

<p class="center smcap">To John Bull.</p>

<p class="right small">March, 1830.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dear B.</span>,&mdash;It is a long while since I wrote to you, but I
have been in a pick of trubbles about my famlie. Lavv's<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[119]</a></span>
youngest has been vascillated, and the various matter did
not take a feckt&mdash;so that she tuck the small pock natrally,
and I fear will be very much pitied when she comes to grow
up&mdash;however, I must right you a short letter.</p>

<p>You remember my lemontations about the removal of the
Wochmen&mdash;I have quite changed my mind, and am all for
the new blue Pelesse. More specially since what I see they
are going to do, to keep them always ready to put out fires&mdash;they
rehearsed their revolutions one day last week, and,
according to the noosepapers, beat Mounsheer Shabby out
and out&mdash;but they does it by wearing Ass-beastos jackets,&mdash;by
which means they minds fires no more than that young
woman we read of, who lived a hundred years in a Fir-nest&mdash;I
mean Sally Mander.</p>

<p>What a nice man Mr. Main must be, who is one of the
heads of the Pelisse, to take such care to distinguish the fires&mdash;I
have often seen his name up agin the walls, and never
knew what it meant, with F. P. before it&mdash;where it says
"Westminster <em>Main</em>&mdash;always charged." I am sure we hoe
a grate deal to Mr. Peal&mdash;Sir Richard Burney never put out
no fires that I ever heard of, nor any body, except the Fire
Indians, who do it with a wetness to it.</p>

<p>My poor grand-child has been so bad, that I have not been
able to see our new Moll Pomona at Common Garden, but I
hear she overflows the house with people and with tiers&mdash;I
could not stir out and leave little Jacinta, she has had
nothing to eat or drink for these three weeks, but some tappyochre
and a glass of white wine delighted with water.</p>

<p>Only think of the Argand Rooms being burned down, and
the English Uproar House in the Strand&mdash;I hope this last
will be bult up agin, for I think English talons should be
encurridged, and I do love our native wobblers, they are so
much more tuching than the Hightalians&mdash;as for the French
hactors, Potter and Clup and those, they are very funey in
their whey, but not to compare with our hone Thisbeans in
Common Garden or Dreary Lane.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[120]</a></span></p>

<p>Oh, Law! what do you think of Lady Edinborough? is
not her's a curous tail, to think of leaving such a handsome
man as her husband for a foraying prince? I suppose my
Lord will get marred again, to keep the title in the right
line&mdash;he has no hair apparent now, I believe.</p>

<p>I can add no moor at present, for the Physicking is come;
and as I must give him his phee, I may as well insult him,
and get all I can out of him, for now that Jacinta is better,
I pomps him for the noose off the Bo mond, which these
Dogturs know more off than most peepil. I will wright soon
agen, and give you a hysterical account of all our proceeduns.

MRS. RAMSBOTTOM'S OPINIONS ON PUBLIC

<p><span class="smcap">Dear B.</span>,&mdash;Here we are, once more in the capitol&mdash;Fulmer
has hops in the Wigs to give him a plaice&mdash;he has been a
fishing a long time, and has cocht nothing yet; and I fear
now they <em>have</em> got in, the old tale of more pigs than tits will
be new revived.</p>

<p>What do you think of Hairy Broom as Chancesellor?&mdash;Lord
Crows-nest on the Wulsack&mdash;or a half-pay Captun
(brevet Lefttenant Kernel) as Master of the Ordinance&mdash;or
my friend Lord Drum, the coal-merchant, as Lord Privy;
not to speak of Nero Denman as Attorny-General, or Newark
Wilde as Solissiter&mdash;Why is all this?&mdash;Just because a parsel
of lazy fellers did not like to go out in a wet night to vote
for the Civil List&mdash;I'm sure the names of them as did not go
to support the King, should be published, and called the <em>uncivil</em>
list, as a disttinkshun.</p>

<p>Well, never was I more surprized. Here, says I, after the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[121]</a></span>
Revelation in France is ended, after settling the affairs of the
Ditch and the Belchians, to think of a two do in London.
Poor Charles Deece is almost forgotten. It is true his fort
was firing his ordnance among the people, and my French
sun-in-law cries "<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Baa les Tyriens</i>" whenever we spike of
him. He says, says he, "I don't mean nobody in party-colour,
but (he rot this bit himself) <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Qui capit ille facit</i>," to
which my other sun-in-law, Fulmer, says, "that Charles
Deece might have overcome the danger, but that he was the
<em>Capet</em> who would not <em>face it</em>."</p>

<p>Fulmer has sent a long pistol to the Primer to ask for
something; but he says of course the <em>Greys</em> will be beset by
the <em>Duns</em>, and that all the hungry ones can't expect to be felled
at once; besides, he doesn't expect this set to last. I'm sure
such a parcel of things never was put into a Cabinet before,
except to be looked at, as curosittes.</p>

<p>We was a rustycatting at Warmer, near Deel, on Lord
Mayor's Day, but the weather has grown so much colder, I
was glad to git away from old Ossian; they was all on the
<em>Key</em> weave, in the City, that day. Sir Clod is a great genus,
and always was&mdash;he was much above his calling when he was
a Hatturney&mdash;he was made to ride on a wite oss afore the
King.</p>

<p>I see somebody has sent his Majesty a pair of boots, and
somebody else has sent the King and Queen a cake, which,
the Lord Chambermaid rites word, was uncommon nice&mdash;is
it because the Wigs won't let the Royal Family have enuff
munny to live upon, that their subjex send them such things?</p>

<p>I wonder that Lord Angelseye should go to Hireland
agin; he was a Poplar ruler when he was last there, but the
case is haltered now; if he should be hill when he is out at
Doubling, with the Tig Dollyroo, I suppose Sir Francis
Birdhit will go to Mr. Singeing Long, and be robbed for
him. Only think of that Long; I'm sewer if the New
Jewry find such a Furdickt as the Old Jewry did, the Gudge
ought not to suffer him to be <em>Long</em> in this country. I think<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[122]</a></span>
it would be better to let him be tried by the Old Bayley,
rather than by either of the <em>Parks</em>&mdash;only he is all for the
west end of the Mephistophiles, and is supported by the
Hairystockcrazy.</p>

<p>Your friend Fillpot <em>is</em> maid a Bishop, although you said
he never woud be. What do you say to <em>that</em>? The dear
Duck of Wellington thought as Fillypotty had <em>ratified</em> his
part of the agreement he would <em>ratify his</em>&mdash;Filly will be
near Cardinal Weld at Exeter, and his Imminence perhaps
will bring Toby quite round, and get him made Pop of
Rheum one of these days. It is quite rite, however, that
when he gets his mitered coach he shoud give up his
Stanhope&mdash;he can't want both, and at such a distance, too,
from itch other.</p>

<p>Do you think Sir Scarlet will be Lord Chief Jester in
the room of Lord Tenderdone? Fulmer tells me that Hairy
Broom says he won't be Lord Chancesellor, which makes
me think the thing is quite curtain that he will; he wants
to be Master of the Roles he says, so has to have his fling
in the House of Cummons; but the Master wont go&mdash;he
likes a quiet life and no nonsense&mdash;no cabnets and wulsack
wurk, but soshability and a leetel haycarty in the evenings.
I honner his honner for his taste and his furmness; a good
Leach always sticks fastest&mdash;besides, it spits Broom, and
that is just "<em>cum il fot</em>," as the French says.</p>

<p>I dont see that Mr. A. B. C.-rombie has got anything in
this scrimble-scramble. I am glad Lord Goodyrich is cum
back, for a kinder-arted, more hamiable man there is not
in all the whirld. Sir James Graham, as Fust Lord of the
Admirability is curous, but Mr. Spring Tide as the Secretairer
seems an uncommon proper apintment.</p>

<p>Fulmer tells me that Lord Hill has got the <em>Blues</em>&mdash;I am
sorry his Lordship takes the change of Minsters so much
to heart. I hope he will keep up his spirts, for every
body has nose him, loves him.</p>

<p>There is a very scandallous report going about, that Lord<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[123]</a></span>
Holland is going to keep the Duchess of Lancaster&mdash;I dont
believe it for many reasons&mdash;one is, I never heard of the
Lady before, unless it is your friend the Princess of Olive
Serres, who has got her rites at last; but then Lord Holland
would not do sich a thing as that; at least I conseeve not.</p>

<p>Perhaps, dear B., you will send me a billey in the coarse
of the weak, and if anything good should turnip for Fulmer
I will let you no&mdash;he is by no means partycolour&mdash;any
place, from a Lord Precedents down to a porters, would
suit him&mdash;he is equally fit for all; besides, in a squabble
like this, nobody sticks at fitness.</p>

CONVERT TO "REFORM."</h3>

<p class="center smcap">To John Bull.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dear B.</span>,&mdash;It is a long time since you have heard from
me,&mdash;and now I do write, you will find me somewhat
haltered in my principles. I have been one over by my

stopping till we have got the Ballad and General Sufferance&mdash;as
to the first, I am all for the song; but with regard to

if he is a friend of Lord John Rustles, that is efficient&mdash;the

I am enlightened&mdash;the peeple <em>must have refurm</em>&mdash;my
shoemaker says so, and I know it must be so; and as Lord
Drum is at the bottom of the Refurm Bile, I love him&mdash;he
looks as if he had been making the bile for some time.
Oh, B., he is an intersting crechur, and so good natured,
it is quite unpossible to void having a puncheon for him.</p>

<p>I admit at first the Cabnet was in a quandary&mdash;that
Polly Thomson isn't poplar amongst them. I think they
are jellies of Polly, for he most certainly has talons&mdash;Fulmer
says he nose he has&mdash;he is a great ventriloquist (I think
they call it), which speaks many forin tongs&mdash;indeed,
Fulmer sometimes calls him Pollyglot as well as Polly
Thomson, and he told me the other day that the King was
going to create him Barren Barilla, and sent him out
Protector of Grease, instead of Prince Loophole, who, as
they call it, bagged out.</p>

<p>Then Lord Althrop&mdash;what a deal of good he has dun
since he has bein in Hoffys. Look at his entrenchments&mdash;he
has cut down the odd eater of the Civil List, and tuck
off the dooty on koles&mdash;and wot a deal more he would have
dun if the axe of parlymen of hother dace had not perwented
him. And as for Lord Grey himself, I <em>do</em> say sich a kind-arted
man as not been seen for ears and ears&mdash;not a sun,
nor a cussin, nor a nevy, nor a sun-in-law, nor a wife's cussin,
nor one hingyvigyal belonging to him, but wot he has perwided
for, somehow or another. Shew me a Prim Minster as hever
hacted in sich a generous way afore&mdash;Why the Duck of
Wellington, with all his fine toe doos, when he was in place,
never guv nothing vhatsoever to any of his relations as ever
I heard of&mdash;ard-arted Duck.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[125]</a></span></p>

<p>And then that sweet Muster Cullcraft&mdash;a dear gentleman,
full of Janus, and as neat and as nice as a nine-pin&mdash;he is
the Ugh!-nit which guv the majority, and all by thinking
twice, which is a wise thing in a man&mdash;I was not at all
surprized when I heard that the nice crechur voted with
the eyes&mdash;for, says I to my Lavy, he has very little to say
to the nose, anyhow. But he was always a favourite with
the ladies&mdash;a regalar Feel-hander amongst them. And then
his pore sun Granny too, to have lost his Love&mdash;more's the
petty, for they are a nice fam'ly take 'em all to gather&mdash;</p>

<p>I hope Lord Bruffham and Fox comes up with your expectorations&mdash;he
certainly does with his hone&mdash;I went, the
other night, into "Tommy's box;" I don't know why they
called the place so&mdash;it was like a vaper bath, with certains
all round it; and there I seed the Chanceseller lying full-length
on the Wulsack&mdash;(which I thought a hod thing to
have in sich a place)&mdash;and I am told he may be seen lying
there every night&mdash;when I say lying, I mean stretching,&mdash;and
poor nobleman, no wonder, for he must be a most tired out&mdash;wot
with the intrests of the nayshun, and the cawses in his
Court, and the trouble he is at to keep silence there&mdash;and
carrion the bag&mdash;and riting leaden articles in the noos-peppers,
and his repeals, and one thing and the other. Have
you seen his pitcher in the Suffocating gallery of Artists?&mdash;there
he is, as like as like can be, but only carycachurd,
which is not to be wundered at, for the pitcher is panted by
Lord Lonsdale&mdash;(so the cattle-hog says)&mdash;and as his Lordship
always made him look blue on the pole, its no wunder
he has made him look yellow on the canvas&mdash;for blue and
yellow is Bruffham's cullers. The pictcher, however, is in
the best place in the room, in complement to the Lord
Chanceseller&mdash;so that them as was ordered to hang his
Lordship, have done him only justass.</p>

<p>Then there is Lord Pummicestone&mdash;he is another of my<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[126]</a></span>
feverits&mdash; where did you ivir see such a Foraying Minster as
he&mdash;so genteel&mdash;so haymable&mdash;and with sich nice wiskers and
white linen&mdash;never interfeering the least with any nonsense
about polyticks&mdash;never sayin a word about his hoffice, either
in Parlyment or out of it, as I hears on; he troubles his
head no more about the Belchians and the Ditch, or the
Roosians, or the Proossians, or hany of the oosians, than I do.
I'm told (by Parr and Tess) that there are no hops for the
Poles&mdash;their caws is desprut&mdash;at least so the Old Engine we
met last season at the sea side told me the day before
yesterday, as I seed him cumming out of the Horizontal Club
in Handover-square;&mdash;nevertheless, I think Lord Pummicestone
is quite wyse for not talkin&mdash;when one nose littel, it is
the safest way to say nothink. However, I may be preggudiced
in his fever, for his Lordship has promised to do the
jalap wuth me, at an opp wich a frend of ours in Taffystalk-square
is to give next munth&mdash;I thoft my duncing days
was gun, but woo can resist Lord Pummicestone&mdash;that would
be a <em>task</em>.</p>

<p>Pursenal felines, however, shud not halways way with
us, but since Fulmer as taken this turn towards refurm, all
the Minsters have been so servile to us, that we are quite
churmed. Lord Hockland, though no grate things in the
Guvment, is sich a haffable, warm arted cretur&mdash;sich an insinivating
Pier&mdash;and Sir Jims Graham, so hunassuming, and
at the same time such a fine man&mdash;how he turrified that
Ogreman Mahoon&mdash;did you see how the pore fellur was put
to a nonplush; and how he croed over O'Konnell like a kok&mdash;Grame
kim out of that, splendid&mdash;there is'nt nothink but
<em>that</em> to be sed about it; so did Lord Althrop with Mr.
Plummet Wad&mdash;a very hominous name for a querrel&mdash;he that
he cocht in his entrenchment at St. Jimses&mdash;Oh! it makes
one prowd to see such Neros as these.</p>

<p>But nothink will do&mdash;everybody wich wares shurts and
has munney in their pokets abuses this bill of Lord Drums;
they say the bill may parse, but nobody can conster it; and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[127]</a></span>
they tells us that the honly claws they can understand in the
bill is the Divil's claws, which has set his foot in it. To be
sure, B., I must say, looking at things as they stand, cutting
off sixty-two members at a blow is a serous hopperation&mdash;I
hone it is very like a Revelation. Old Tim with the firelock,
however, will shoe the effex; and (as I says to Lavy, whenever
I have a fit of coffin) wen we are in our graves, what
will it signify to hus?</p>

<p>I <em>am</em> for Reform&mdash;and I hone it. The King, they say, is
for it&mdash;at wich I wunder; and the Queen is agin it&mdash;at
wich I do not wunder. But Mr. Christopher Stubbs, our hopposite
neighbore, is for it; and that has decided me&mdash;for
<em>he</em> hadmires Lord Pummicestone, and Mister Cullcraft, and
Mr. Singeing Long&mdash;so I think he has had some new lights
lately. Singeing Long, after having stood twice at the Hold
Bayley, and having been only returned once, is going to
hoffer himself for the parish of Marrowbone, as what Fulmer
calls the "<em>knee</em> plus ultra."</p>

<p>And now, B., let us snitch a minuet from Pollyticks, and
Pollygots, and Polly Thomsons, for a moral inflexion or
two; here is Hester come agin&mdash;Puck, as the Galls call it&mdash;the
trees is begining to shoot, just as the bows is ceesing to
unt; the sweet Buds (I ope you like Hornithology) are commencing
their wobblings on the branches, and are hable to do
wot is wise as well as pleasant&mdash;turn over a new leaf every
day of their lives. Hadam and Heve did so before them,
wich is a good President.</p>

<p>Wot a splundid site it is to behold the wurks of natur&mdash;the
great Halps&mdash;Strumbolli&mdash;Hetna&mdash;the sparrowgrass piping
out of the beds at Battersea&mdash;Burnells funnell under the
Thames&mdash;and the Cosmorammy in Regent Street&mdash;but one
has no time for these thinks at present. I ham absobbed
with the grate question, and I culd not rest till I opened

MRS. RAMSBOTTOM ON THE HOUSE OF LORDS.</h3>

<p class="center smcap">To John Bull.</p>

<p class="right small">Clappem Kommon, Hoct. 14, 1831.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dear B</span>.,&mdash;What will you Aunty-reformers say now. The
parlyment is to be berogued, and your hopes are all blyted&mdash;now
my expectorations are answerd&mdash;this is a nice two do&mdash;Fulmer,
who is on your side, sings what he calls his
High Ho Pea hens, but I cant agree with him, because Mr.
Ram was a wriggler radical, and so am I, because I do not
know no better, and theerfor I redes the <em>Tims</em>, and am quite
agreable to the pinions of the Head-eater of that pepper.</p>

<p>I have bin to hear the debretts of the peerage&mdash;we had
seets in the House of Lauds. What a man that Hairy
Broom is&mdash;what a spich he made, and how thrusty he got&mdash;I
askd what it was he was a drinking, and they told me a
Bishop&mdash;he seemd as if he could have swallowed the See.
He had the tumblers hin, ot and ot, like the stakes at his
Club&mdash;but when he went down upon his Marybones, I was
quite resolved into tiers, for feer he never coud git up agin.</p>

<p>Lord Grey is a fine cretur, but very grey indeed; I remember
him as Lord Howweak many years ago. I saw Lord
Monster too, and the Kernel which has the Kopper minds,
who is called Lord Dinnerbell, because of his feedin a great
Duck at his ouse in Whales.</p>

<p>I had a not from Lord Pummicestone, to tell me he was
not gone to resign&mdash;he poots hup with a grate deal from Lord<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[129]</a></span>
Grey and Broom, and even from Lord Drum, when he is
well enough to go to the Cabinet&mdash;that was a purty scrap he
got into about Ninnyveal, the Ditchman; and now I heer
he is another two do about the Emperor of the Brass-heels&mdash;Lewey
Flip does not like given up the Portingal ships, and
as we does everything Tallyrong thinks right, why we must
not grumble&mdash;this is Pummicestone's noose to me. If the
King of Spain helps Don M'Gill they say he will suckseed in
keeping his hone&mdash;the Spanish is all he wants to put him to
rites. As for Rooshy and Prooshy, P. says he can't say
much about them, only I see that Leaving has not left, and
that Bowlow is halso here&mdash;but else foraying affairs seems
below pa.</p>

<p>The Bishop of Lundun did not vote agin the Bile&mdash;I herd
why&mdash;his first start in life was hoeing to a translation&mdash;he
wants to try another&mdash;this is Greek to me, Mr. B.</p>

<p>I think the people are just shewing their spirt&mdash;Honly
think of Lord Lunnunderry pooling out a pistole, and fritening
such a manny men as he did. They are rong to set phire to
houses, and as for the Hayfair at Knottingham Castle, it was
absird hin the hextream, for to <em>my</em> mind the surest way of
raising the New Castles, is burning down the old ones.</p>

<p>Our friend P. applyed to me to see and ask Fulmer to be
made a pier this time; and Lavy would like to be a Vice-countess
she says&mdash;a Barreness she would not listen to; but
I did not like to say anything to F., because Lord P. said
"He was wanted to carry the Bill through the House of
Lords;"&mdash;these are P.'s hone words out of his leather to
me, and I <em>do</em> think Fulmer was born and bred to better
things than to do porter's work at his time of life&mdash;Hif they
wants "the Bill carried through the House," why dont they
imploy survunts of their hone, without trying to disgrace
onest people witch is as good as themselves?</p>

<p>Pray what do they mean by sayin "whipster of a fraction,"
wenever they talk of Lord John Rustle? I think it is in allusion
to some of his impotence in the Ouse of Kommons. Fulmer<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[130]</a></span>
says that his Ludship can't bear ironing&mdash;he sims to me to
have been mangled last Wensday&mdash;however, I'm all for
Refurm, and Lord Grey, and Universal Suffering, and Vote
by Ballad. And now the Bill has been rejected, I am ready
for another hole Bill, and nothing but the Bill&mdash;and you
mark my words, Mr. B., you will be hobliged to pool in your
orns afore you have dun.</p>

<p>The King must be a good deal wurried, wot with wun
thing and hanuther. If I was he, I never would let Minsters
hoverrule me&mdash;I <em>would</em> have my own whey, and hif I could
not master them piecably, I wood do as Fulmer says, "cut
the Jordan knot at once, and resolve the Parlyment."</p>

<p>Say somethink in your pepper, that may show me you
have got this.&mdash;Yours, still in frenchship,</p>

<p class="right smcap wsp">D. L. Ramsbottom.</p>

<p>P.S.&mdash;I forgot to tell you my fourth gull, Addlehead, is
going to be marred next week to Dr. Pillycooshy, of Peckham.</p>

<p>"Hook had returned to England penniless; but he brought with him
stores, the result of increased knowledge of the world and of an observation
active under every vicissitude of fortune, which, with his singular
facility in composition, were readily reducible to current coin. According,
notwithstanding the harassing and protracted business at the Audit-office,
he found time to strike off a succession of papers and pamphlets,
the proceeds of which for some months formed his sole income. These,
for obvious reasons, were published anonymously; and from this fact,
and that of their being for the most part mere hits at the politics of the
day, they have, with scarcely an exception, been swept from the face of
the literary globe, and are only to be met with in the museums of such
curious collectors as Tom Hill and the like.</p>

<p>"One of these <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">jeux d'esprit</i>, entitled '<em>Tentamen</em>; or, an Essay towards
the History of Whittington, some time Lord Mayor of London, by Dr.
Vicesimus Blinkinsop,' produced no little sensation, and ran rapidly
through two or three editions. Hook, however, we believe, was not suspected
to be the author. This <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">opusculum</i>, which is now extremely rare,
and a copy of which would fetch quadruple its original price, was an
attack, conducted in a strain of elaborate irony, equal to the happiest
efforts of Martinus Scriblerus, upon the worthy Alderman Wood (a
portrait of whom adorned the title-page), and his royal <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">protégée</i>."&mdash;<em>Barham.</em></p></div>

London so honourably celebrated in the preceding enumeration
of your titles, is a combination of merits wholly unexpected
and unprecedented. You alone, Sir, among the
members of scientific bodies, can glory in being a Fishmonger;
and you alone, among Fishmongers, can boast of
being President of the Society of Arts.</p>

<p>Glorious, and more truly honourable, than rank or ribbons,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[212]</a></span>
is the list of the numerous charities of which your Royal
Highness is the ostensible head. It may seem, at first
sight, inconsistent with the Christian precepts to give so
much notoriety to benevolent actions; but, even in this
view, your Royal Highness's conduct is above all imputation:
that precept applies to the hand, and not to the head;
and though your Royal Highness gives your great personal
weight to the chair of those associations, your worst enemy
cannot say that you were ever known to give any thing else.
Your left hand (which, agreeably to the scriptural suggestion,
is as discerning as your Royal Highness's intellect) does certainly
not know of any particular charity, performed by your
Royal Highness's right hand.</p>

<p>You are thus enabled, Sir, to extend the sphere of your
utility and beneficence. Actual donations must have had
a limit; but the charity which costs nothing, may, as we see
in your Royal Highness's case, be indefinitely extended, to
the great encouragement and increase of the contributions
of others.</p>

<p>To all the above mentioned distinctions, equally high,
equally honourable, and equally deserved, your Royal Highness,
on the principle just stated,&mdash;that you have still
countenance enough to bestow on meritorious institutions,&mdash;has
intimated your gracious intention of succeeding Sir
Joseph Banks as President of the Royal Society. Amongst
your many and obvious claims to this situation, the first
is, that you are a <em>fishmonger</em>; for thus your Royal Highness
will be in a condition to solve that celebrated problem propounded
to the Society by its Royal Founder Charles the
Second, and which has not been yet satisfactorily explained,
relative to the respective gravities of fish, dead or alive.
Nor if the late President had been a fishmonger, would the
Society have been involved in the failure and disgrace of
that experiment which the indignant poet has immortalized
by the line</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[213]</a></span></p>
<p>But though I could not avoid touching upon these matters,
it is as a citizen of London, and as the condescending friend
of our most patriotic magistrates&mdash;our modern Whittingtons&mdash;that
I presume to address your Royal Highness, and to
solicit your favour to an essay towards the history of that
great man, the honour of which cannot fail to be reflected on
his successors; and in addition to this gracious patronage
for myself, I am charged by others to solicit your Royal
Highness, to be pleased to lend your name as President to
a new literary and most useful association, held in Bearbinder
Lane, at the back of the Mansion House, called "The
Whittington Institution, for teaching Aldermen to read,
write, cypher, and dance, on Mr. Lancaster's system."</p>

<p>In humble hope of your Royal Highness's most gracious
condescension, I have the honour to remain, Sir,</p>

<p class="right padr4">Your Royal Highness's</p>

<hr class="r15" />

<p class="drop-capx">In looking at the propensities of the age we live in, comparatively
with those of times past, one cannot fail to
observe a laudable love for the noble science of antiquities:
of which it may be truly said, that it is conversant with
peaceful and unoffending yesterdays, while the idle votaries
of the world are busied about to-day, and the visionaries of
ambition are dreaming of to-morrow.</p>

<p>Connected with this grave and useful pursuit is the general
inclination to search into the minutiæ of history, which never
before prevailed amongst us in so ardent a degree. The
smallest information upon traditional points is received with
an avidity more salutary and commendable than that which
is the result of a commonplace love of novelty; and the
smaller the information, the greater the merit of the painstaking
author; who, like a skilful clock-maker, or other
nice handy-craftsman, is lauded in proportion to the minuteness
of his work.</p>

<p>Such are, for instance, the valuable discoveries which that
excellent philosopher and novelist Mr. Godwin hath made
and edited, of and concerning the great poet Chaucer; and,
inasmuch as the nice and small works of clock-makers,
which we have mentioned, are carefully placed in huge
towers and steeples, beyond malicious or impertinent
curiosity, so this prudent philosopher hath disposed his small<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[216]</a></span>
facts in two tall volumes, equally out of the reach of the
vulgar.</p>

<p>Such also are those valuable illustrations of the private
lives of public men which have issued from the Press under
the titles of "Ana," "Remains," and "Memoirs," and which
have so admirably answered the purposes for which they
were put forth&mdash;namely, that of being sold&mdash;while they at
the same time maintain a discreet silence on all matters which
the ingenious subject of the biography might wish to conceal,
agreeably to that excellent maxim, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">de mortuis nil nisi bonum</i>:
by these means, such treatises become a delectable kind of
reading, wherein nothing is admitted which can hurt the
feelings of any of the worthy persons mentioned in the course
of the work, particularly if they be deceased. This mode of
writing conduces to good humour and charity amongst men,
and manifestly tends, as Dr. Johnson observes on another
occasion, to raise the general estimate of human nature.</p>

<p>On these principles and considerations have I been induced,
at no small cost of time and labour, to endeavour to throw a
new light upon the life of Matthew Whittington, some time
Mayor (or Lord Mayor, as the courtesy goeth) of this worthy
City of London,&mdash;a man, whose fame needs no addition, but
only to be placed in a proper point of view, to challenge the
admiration of a grateful posterity of Mayors and Aldermen.</p>

<p>In humble imitation of my aforesaid friend Mr. Godwin,
and of divers other well-reputed authors, I have written this
life in one hundred and seventy-eight quires of foolscap
paper, in a small and close, but neat hand; which by my
computation, having counted the number of words therein
contained, as well as the number of words in the learned
Bishop Watson's life of himself (which made my excellent
friend Dr. Snodgrass, who lent me the same, facetiously
declare, that I was the only man he ever knew who could
get through it); I say, having counted all these words, I
find that my life of Mr. Whittington (including thirteen
quires on the general history of Cats) would, if duly printed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[217]</a></span>
after the manner of Mr. Davison, who never puts more than
sixteen lines into a quarto page, make or constitute five
volumes of a similar size and shape to Dr. Watson's life,
which, with cuts by Mr. John Britton, author of several
curious topographical works, might be sold for the reasonable
sum of £31 10<em>s.</em>, being only six guineas the volume; and if
it should please the Legislature, in its wisdom, to repeal the
Copy-right Bill (by which costly books are made accessible
to poor students at the Universities, who have no business
with such sort of works), my said work might be furnished
at the reduced price of £31 4<em>s.</em> 6<em>d.</em></p>

<p>But small as this sum is, it is with grief I say, that such
is the badness of the times, occasioned by the return of
peace, and the late long succession of plentiful harvests, that
I find booksellers strangely reluctant to embark in this
transaction with me.<a name="FNanchor_28" id="FNanchor_28"></a><a href="#Footnote_28" class="fnanchor">[28]</a> They offer indeed to print my work
if I can get it previously praised in the <cite>Edinburgh Review</cite>;
and the Reviewers say, that they are not unwilling to praise
it, but that it must, of a necessity, be previously printed.</p>

<p>I have observed to Mr. Jeffrey in my seventh letter to
him on this subject, that this condition is not only new and
injurious to me, but, by his own showing, clearly gratuitous
and unnecessary; because, for aught that appears in the
generality of his articles, he may never have read the work
which is the subject-matter of them; nay, it hath sometimes
been proved from the context, that he never hath even seen
the work at all; and as this little accident hath not hindered
his writing an excellent essay under colour of such work, so
I contended, that he need not now make the preliminary
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">sine quâ non</i>, as to having my work printed; for "<span lang="la" xml:lang="la">de non
impressis et de non lectis eadem est ratio.</span>"</p>

<p>But I grieve to say, that all my well-grounded reasoning<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[218]</a></span>
hath been unavailing; and as neither party will give up his
notion, I stand at a dead lock between the booksellers and
reviewers.</p>

<p>In this dilemma, I should&mdash;like Aristotle's celebrated ass&mdash;have
starved till doomsday; but that, through the kindness
and prudent advice of my learned friends Mr. Jonas Backhouse,
Jun. of Pocklington, and the Rev. Doctor Snodgrass
of Hog's-Norton, I have been put upon a mode of extricating
myself, by publishing, in a small form, a tentamen, specimen,
or abridgement of part of my great work, which I am told
Mr. Jeffrey will not object to review, he being always ready
to argue "<span lang="la" xml:lang="la">à particulari ad universale</span>:" so that, in future
time, the learned world may have hope of seeing my erudite
labours at full length, whereof this dissertation is a short
and imperfect sample or pattern.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>The whole history of the illustrious Whittington is enveloped
in doubt. The mystery begins even before he is
born; for no one knows who his mother, and still less who
his father, was. We are in darkness as to where he first
saw the light, and though it is admitted that he most probably
had a Christian name, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">adhuc sub judice lis est</i>, as to
what that Christian name was.</p>

<p>This important point, however, my revered friend, the Rev.
Dr. Snodgrass of Hog's-Norton hath enabled me to decide.</p>

<p>Tradition has handed down to us that Whittington was a
charity boy, as it is called, and received the rudiments of
letters at the parish school of Hog's-Norton aforesaid; this
clue directed the Doctor's researches, and by that enlightened
zeal for which he was conspicuous, he has been so fortunate
as to discover rudely carved on the wainscot by some fellow-pupil,</p>

<p class="center small">
M. W. IS A FOOL;<br />
M. W. IS A DUNCE;<br />
And one, which is more satisfactory,<br />
M&mdash;&mdash;W, W. IS A STUPID DOG,<br />
1772.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[219]</a></span></p>

<p>This date seems at first sight to apply to a period long
posterior to Mr. Whittington; but when we recollect how
often the wisest men, the most careful copyists, the most
expert printers, mistake dates and transpose figures, we are
not to be surprised at a similar error in an unlettered and
heedless school-boy; and therefore, as Dr. Snodgrass
judiciously advises&mdash;(a noble conjecture indeed, which places
the critic almost on a level with the original writer)&mdash;the
mistake may be corrected by the simple change of placing
the figures in their obvious proper order, 1277, which, as Mr.
Whittington is known to have been Sheriff or Mayor about
the year 1330, when he was probably near sixty, shews that
he was about seven when at Hog's-Norton; and proves
incontestably, that to him and him alone these ancient and
fortunately discovered inscriptions refer.</p>

<p>Having established their authenticity, it is easy to show
that Mr. Whittington's name was not Richard, as the vulgar
fondly imagine; R, and not M, being the initial of Richard;
and we might perhaps have doubted between Matthew,
Mathias, Moses, Melchisedec or Mark; but the concluding
W. of the last inscription seems to settle the matter in favour
of Matthew, which is the only name that I know of in
ordinary use which begins with M, and ends, as all the world
sees, with a W.</p>

<p>I shall say little of an erroneous supposition&mdash;built on the
strength of the words "fool," "dunce," and "stupid dog;"
and on the manifestly mistaken date,&mdash;which would refer
these characteristic sentences to a worthy alderman now
alive; (with whose initials they do, indeed, by a strange
accident, agree.) Such a supposition is clearly false and
untenable, as may be proved by one decisive observation,
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">inter alia</i>; that they appear to be the work of some jealous
rival, displeased at Mr. Whittington's superior ability:
perhaps they were even engraved by a fraud on the parish
furniture, after Mr. Whittington's rise had given some handle
to envy; whereas it is well known and universally admitted,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[220]</a></span>
to be the happiness of the worthy alderman now alive, that
no human being either ever did, or could envy <em>him</em>:&mdash;this
sets that important question asleep for ever.</p>

<p>It may seem to some readers that these epithets,&mdash;opprobria,
as some may think them,&mdash;do not redound to the
credit of Mr. Alderman Whittington's intellect; but even if
they are not, as before suggested, the production of envy, they
are by no means inconsistent with Whittington's successful
progress in life; on the contrary, they seem to designate
him as a person who would naturally rise to City honours. It
is grown to be a proverb, and admitted by the best writers
on the subject, that Lord Mayors are "stupid dogs."<a name="FNanchor_29" id="FNanchor_29"></a><a href="#Footnote_29" class="fnanchor">[29]</a> The
City hath a prescription to choose "fools," for places of
honour therein; and, as Matthew was at least twice Lord
Mayor, he might with great propriety have been twice as
great a fool as any of the others.</p>

<p>This leads me to the important consideration of how often
the illustrious Matthew had the honour of so worthily filling
the Civic throne.</p>

<p>An ancient and well-known ballad has this beautiful, and
indeed important, rhyme,&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<p class="verse8">"&mdash;&mdash; &mdash;&mdash; Whittington,</p>
<p class="verse"><em>Twice</em> Lord Mayor of London."<a name="FNanchor_30" id="FNanchor_30"></a><a href="#Footnote_30" class="fnanchor">[30]</a></p>
</div></div></div>

<p>Some copies indeed, and one in particular, (penis R. Pria
Knight, F.R.S.) have it "thrice." This, however, on a
careful collation with all the best MSS. and some very fair
black-letter editions, has been most satisfactorily disproved:
it has crept into the old versions, either from the well-known
predilection for the <em>trine</em> number; or, from the writer's
having composed the work during Matthew's second
Mayoralty, when, as it appears from some old papers in the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">[221]</a></span>Tower, he, as well as many of his zealous friends, had a
notion that he would have been again elected to the dignified
office which he had for two successive years filled so satisfactorily&mdash;to
himself.</p>

<p>That such a re-election would have delighted him, nobody
can doubt, who is aware of the fact of his being so anxious
to discharge correctly the duties of his great office, that he
practised the part,&mdash;or, as it is in one account quaintly
phrased, <em>played at Lord Mayor</em>,&mdash;for some time before he
had attained the station; and for many years after he had
passed the chair, evinced his gratitude by keeping up the
same laudable practice. An old account of one of his private
dinners states, that even to the day of his death, when he
was at home, he sat in state at the head of his table, with his
loving spouse beside him, and his chief guest, if it were but the
deputy of the ward, upon his right, while the other members
of his family were ranged as regularly in order as if they
had been at the Easter dinner in the Mansion House.</p>

<p>As it affects Mr. Whittington's character, the little variation
between twice and thrice is at present quite immaterial. He
that deserved to be twice Lord Mayor could hardly have been
additionally ennobled by having been so three or more times;
and, considering that the statements rest on public rumour,
and, perhaps, the partiality of friends, of which not one-half
is generally true, it seems a not unfair proportion to believe
two-thirds.</p>

<p>But, proud as Matthew naturally was at his double elevation,
for he had sitten on the two forks of the civic Parnassus, it
seems that in a subsequent period of his life he began to
grow weary of his legitimate honours, and bursting from that
civic chrysalis, the alderman's gown, strove to soar by gaudier
flights into what it may be imagined he deemed better company.
But the City Icarus tried his wings, there is reason
to suppose, in a temperature somewhat too glowing; and if
it were not for that indulgent principle of modern biography
to which I have alluded, of saying nothing disagreeable either<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">[222]</a></span>
of the living or dead, I might be able to show that Matthew
had earned the detestation of some, the ridicule of others, and
the contempt of all, and forfeited much of that grave respect
which aldermen are heirs to, by presuming to meddle with
things the which he could of no possibility understand.</p>

<p>The several particulars of his life upon which the old
Chronicles are at variance, and which in my large work I
think I may&mdash;<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">absit invidia</i>&mdash;say, I have reconciled and
explained, are these:&mdash;</p>

<p>1. His political principles.</p>

<p>2. His trade, and what it really was.</p>

<p>3. The quality of his intellect.</p>

<p>4. The quantity<a name="FNanchor_31" id="FNanchor_31"></a><a href="#Footnote_31" class="fnanchor">[31]</a> of his intellect.</p>

<p>5. Whether the bells did preternaturally ring his recall to
London; or, whether it were merely the force of his own
vanity which gave this favourable meaning to an idle sound.</p>

<p>6. Whether he really was maltreated, as tradition reports,
by a kitchen-maid.</p>

<p>7. What sort of company he kept.</p>

<p>8. What the Cat was by which he rendered himself chiefly
notorious, and whether his famous expedition to catch the
Cat was undertaken prior, or subsequently, to his second
Mayoralty.</p>

<p>9. And lastly, whether he died a natural or disgraceful
death.</p>

<p>All these are points at issue, and will probably so continue
till the publication of my great work, except one, namely,
the 8th, which relates to his memorable Cat, upon which it
is my intention to offer in this <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">opusculum</i> some lights and
solutions.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">[223]</a></span></p>
<p>History cannot perhaps be impartially written during the
lives of those to whom it relates, and the nine-fold term of
existence assigned to the feline species has probably been
the cause of much of the misrepresentation which we are,
alas! doomed to deplore; but sufficient time has now elapsed
since Whittington, and even since his Cat, left the world,
to have destroyed every particle of prejudice, and it is a
great satisfaction to me to be able to speak plainly upon the
subject, without the fear of an imputation of any feeling,
other than a strict love of truth and justice, tempered and
directed by that candid resolution which I have avowed, of
not saying a harsh thing even of a dead Cat.</p>

<p>As some of the hypotheses upon the very intricate subject
of the Cat, suppose her to have been a human female, it
seems proper, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">in limine</i>, to satisfy the fair sex, by setting at
rest the disputes which have hitherto existed as to Matthew's
personal appearance. We always feel more interested in a
hero after he has been described to us, even if (as it is in
this case) his <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">tout-ensemble</i> should happen not to be particularly
engaging; indeed, who can be so extravagant and
preposterous as to look for personal beauty in an alderman?
It is therefore not derogating from his great character to
confess that Matthew Whittington, to judge of him by a
woodcut (the only genuine likeness extant), had one of those
hard and vulgar faces which resemble the heads of certain
clumsily-carved walking-sticks, or tobacco-stoppers, in which
a fixed smile relaxes (by the mere comicality of its brisk and
vulgar self-satisfaction) the muscles of the beholders. Mr. W.
seemed to smile eternally at himself, and the smile was so
contagious, that few could look at him without laughing.</p>

<p>It is also necessary towards understanding what is to
follow, that I should touch a little on the progress of this
great man to the mercantile eminence which he afterwards
(whether by means of the Cat or not) attained.</p>

<p>It is known that the Kings of England have a private, or
rather a notoriously public, mark, whereby they distinguish<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">[224]</a></span>
their property, known to the initiated as the King's <em>Broad
Arrow</em>, but vulgarly called the King's Broad R. This mark
is held up by all "dealers in marine stores" of these our
days to their children as the Scylla of their voyage through
life. They are taught never to purloin (if there be any other
within reach) any timber, thick stuff, or plank, or iron or
copper bolts, belaying-pins, gudgeons, stauncheons, fastenings
or sheathing, or any other article having on or about it
the King's Broad Arrow by "stamp, brand, or otherwise,"
and carefully to abstain (as far as possible) from meddling with
any cordage of three inches and upwards wrought with a white
thread the contrary way (which thread is improperly called
the rogue's yarn) or any canvas wrought or unwrought with
a blue streak in the middle; or any bewper wrought with
one or more streaks of raised white tape, as they believe in
and fear the 22 Charles II., cap. 5; the 9 and 10 William
III., cap. 41; 9 George I., cap. 8; 17 George II., cap. 40;
39 and 40 George III., cap. 89, sects. 5 and 6 most especially.<a name="FNanchor_32" id="FNanchor_32"></a><a href="#Footnote_32" class="fnanchor">[32]</a></p>

<p>Unfortunately, Mr. Whittington early in life formed an
intimacy with a man whose name was Joshua, who, for
want of proper tuition, had fallen foul, not exactly of the
above-named statutes (inasmuch as they were enacted long
after his demise, and were therefore, strictly speaking, not
applicable to him) but of sundry others, partly confirmed
and partly repealed by the 31 of Elizabeth, cap. 4, which
unfortunately affected him, since he was detected in the fact
of adapting to his own use sundry marked articles appertaining
to our then liege sovereign, Edward I. This Joshua
was of a very low origin, and was ironically called Joshua
the son of <em>none</em>, never having an ostensible father or mother;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">[225]</a></span>
to which untoward circumstance may be charitably attributed
the errors into which he was occasionally betrayed.
The first notion of property which a child receives, is from
being told, I am <em>your</em> parent; you are <em>my</em> son; this is <em>your</em>
milk; that is <em>his</em> bread. The poor innocent who does not
receive this early instruction is naturally deficient in this
particular; whence it happens that such persons are generally
found rather lax in their principles of <em>meum</em> and <em>tuum</em>
to the end of their lives; which, however, by an equal dispensation
of Providence, are usually shortened by a special
interposition of the law.</p>

<p>Matthew's affection, we are led to believe, was less for
this man's qualities than for his property; and with that
characteristic prudence injuriously called cunning, he resolved
to live on good terms with him, so that, although he should
never run the risk of engaging actively in the acquirement
of capital, he might (knowing how bare of branches Joshua's
family tree was) at some future period get possession of
whatever this receiver-general might have accumulated:
indeed, while quite a lad he continually used to say when
shewing Joshua's cellars full of iron to any acquaintance&mdash;"I
consider that one day or other these will all be mine,
Sir;" and so eventually they were.</p>

<p>It was in allusion to these hoards, and the means and
times by which they were collected, that in the quaint
biblical facetiousness of that age it used to be observed,
that if Joshua of old had known how to do his business by
night, as well as his modern namesake, he need not have
desired the sun to stand still; a witticism which Speed
records with great delight.</p>

<p>It is after this era in Matthew's life that all the writers
are puzzled; it has been ascertained that he was apprenticed
to a trade, but what that trade was, or what affinity it bore
to the traffic he subsequently carried on, nobody has yet
decided. The incident which drove him from his master's
house was, as is generally allowed, a beating (or more<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">[226]</a></span>
technically speaking a basting) which the kitchen wench
gave him as a punishment for purloining a sop in the pan,
a mode of acquiring, to which his admiration of Joshua's
proceedings had probably given him a turn.</p>

<p>It is also added, that Whittington had a sneaking kindness,
or what is politely called a <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">tendre</i> for the housemaid
of the family, who espoused his cause in this very quarrel,
and that he never ceased to retain a feeling of gratitude
towards one of his fellow-servants commensurate with his
just animosity towards the other.</p>

<p>There is a probability on the face of this fact, which
is opposed to the story of his attachment to Miss Alice
Fitzwarren, his master's daughter. Affections or antipathies
formed in youth, and nurtured through life, always manifest
themselves in the more marked peculiarities of age, and
certain it is that Mr. Whittington when in very different
circumstances, maintained his rooted dislike to a Cook,
while his favourite remembrance of the housemaid's kindness
evinced itself in the respect he openly professed for a Broom,
(however cracked or crazy it might be) wherever he saw one.</p>

<p>Having thus selected such preliminary observations as
were necessary by way of introduction in the nature of
prolegomena, I now approach with equal awe and interest
to the main point, which is, as I said before, to ascertain
what the Cat was by which Whittington made himself to be
so well remembered, and which is inseparable from him in
history and imagination. Who thinks of Whittington without
thinking of a Cat? Who with any love of sacred antiquity
can see a Cat without thinking of Whittington?</p>

<p>An English author records a speech made by a very
erudite orientalist and profound scholar, at a meeting of
the Society of Antiquarians, which was preserved in the
minutes of that society, through the generous care of
Mr. S. Foote, and which I am enabled to lay before my
readers, by the favour of Sir Richard Phillips, who, for the
trifling sum of fifteen shillings, obliged me with the works<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">[227]</a></span>
of that eminent Grecian, for so I presume he was, from
his having acquired the surname of Aristophanes.</p>

<p>"Permit me," says the orator, "to clear up some doubts
relative to a material and interesting point of the English
History. Let others toil to illumine the dark annals of
Greece and Rome; my searches are sacred only to the
service of Britain.</p>

<p>"That Whittington lived, no doubt can be made; that
he was Lord Mayor of London, is equally true; but&mdash;as to
<span class="smcap">his Cat</span>&mdash;that, gentlemen, is the Gordian knot to untie&mdash;and
here, gentlemen, be it permitted to me to define what a
Cat is&mdash;a Cat is a domestic, whiskered, four-footed animal,
whose employment is catching of mice; but let a Cat have
been ever so subtle, ever so successful, to what could her
captures amount?&mdash;no tanner could curry the skin of a
mouse&mdash;no family could make a meal of the meat&mdash;consequently,
no Cat could give Whittington his wealth&mdash;from
whence does the error proceed? Be that my care to point
out.</p>

<p>"The commerce this wealthy merchant carried on, was
chiefly confined to our coasts&mdash;for this purpose, he constructed
a vessel, which, from its aptness and lightness, he
christened <span class="smcap">a Cat</span>; nay, gentlemen, to this day&mdash;all our
coals are imported from Newcastle in nothing but <span class="smcap">Cats</span>&mdash;from
thence it appears that it was not the whiskered, four-footed&mdash;mouse-killing
Cat&mdash;but the coasting, sailing, carrying
<span class="smcap">Cat</span>&mdash;that, gentlemen, was Whittington's Cat."</p>

<p class="center">
Vide <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">opera omnia</i> Sam. Foot. Tit. Nabob.&mdash;&mdash;<br />
</p>

<p>I cannot, however, consent in this instance to judge "ex
pede Herculem." However ingenious this learned gentleman's
view of the case may be, we are upon one particular
decidedly at issue; and I think I shall be able to shew, that
Whittington not only did not derive his wealth from the
renowned Cat, but that the Cat was the ultimate cause
of his ruin.</p>

<p>One writer, (Ibbotson on Quadrupeds, vol. viii. p. 381,)
says, that "Shee was no other than a female of highe ranke
and singular kinde harte, who for that shee had a <em>feline</em>
dysposition myghtelie affected Masterre Whyttingtone"&mdash;"which
mistake in the orthography," says my learned friend
Backhouse (who seldom errs), "<em>feline</em> being put for <em>feeling</em>&mdash;has
deluded many into the belief, that it was in truth a four-footed,
whiskered, mouse-catching Cat." This ingenious
conjecture is supported by the other obvious errors of the
same nature <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">in loc. citat.</i> and not a little validated by a
curious ballad of the times, which is to be found at this
moment in the British Museum (Messalina 2.) and of which
I subjoin a copy:&mdash;</p>

<p>This undoubtedly original and authentic document will
be of vast use in elucidating many of our difficulties, as I
shall hereafter abundantly observe; it is here only quoted in
the order of proofs, as supporting Mr. Backhouse's most
acute conjecture; which is also greatly strengthened by that
profound scholar Mr. Hallam, in his "History of the Middle
Ages," who, however, gives a different and more classical
ground for the vulgar error&mdash;&mdash;"This great Lady," he says,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">[230]</a></span>
"was <em>Catta</em>; that is, a <em>German</em>, one of the people called
<em>Catti</em>, who inhabited that part of the ancient Germania now
called the Duchy of Brunswick."</p>

<p>In opposition to all these opinions, Doctor Snodgrass
(whose copious history of the interior of Africa, and genealogy
of the kings of Gambia, sufficiently, as the modest Mr.
Bowdich<a name="FNanchor_33" id="FNanchor_33"></a><a href="#Footnote_33" class="fnanchor">[33]</a> justly observes, stamp his merits) inclines to
think that a person of Matthew's original habits never could
have been thrown into the society of any lady of high rank,
who had a regard for her character or respectability. He
treats the hypothesis of the <em>Cattean</em> Lady with great contempt,
considers the authority of the ballad as trivial and
obscure; and maintains with all that power of argument, so
characteristic of his works, that it was a <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">bona-fide</i> Cat, on
which Whittington's hopes at one particular period were
placed, but which had no connexion whatever with his
pecuniary affairs, and which hopes were moreover in the
sequel frustrated.</p>

<p>A more ancient writer still ("Prendergast on Sorcery")
makes an assertion which at once confirms and refutes all
that has been advanced by my two learned friends, for he
distinctly states, that, that which rendered Whittington
famous, was both a Cat and an illustrious Lady. Not, indeed,
at the same time; but that, being endowed with magical
potency, she was competent to assume both forms at pleasure,
displaying either the savage temper of the quadruped, or the
winning softness of her lovely sex, as best suited her
purpose.</p>

<p>The same author says, that while under the appearance of
a human being she was capable of performing what in those
days passed for miracles; at one time metamorphosing
menials and washer-women into Lords and Ladies; causing
unknown and portentous <em>stars</em> to appear, and changing by
"<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">arte magicale</i>" white into black, and black into white.
He also more fully explains in the same way, the strange<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">[231]</a></span>
facts alluded to in the ballad, of her putting off at pleasure
the form of a cat, and transforming the several feline attributes
and appearances to her followers; giving to one
supernatural whiskers; to another, a covering of fur; to a
third, eyes that can see best in the dark; to a fourth, the
faculty of falling on his legs, whatever may happen, and so
forth.</p>

<p>We now live in an incredulous age, and it is not for me
to decide whether magical interferences with the ordinary
course of nature are to be believed or not. I would rather
refer the curious reader to the Dæmonologia of the royal
and erudite James; for my part, I neither wholly reject,
nor wholly admit, the multitudinous affirmative evidences,
which all histories of all countries, in all ages, afford on this
subject; but I may be allowed to say in support of Prendergast's
hypothesis, that this change of form has, it appears,
been by no means uncommon. Le Père Jacques d'Autun
says, "<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Baram Roi de Bulgaire prenoit par ses prestiges la
figure d'un loup ou <i>d'un autre animal</i></span>;" and Job Fincel
mentions that, "<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">on attrapa un jour un loup garou qui courait
dans les Rues de Padoue: on lui coupa ses pates de loup et
il reprit au même instant la forme d'homme&mdash;mais avec
les bras et les pieds coupés.</span>" These are staggering
authorities!<a name="FNanchor_34" id="FNanchor_34"></a><a href="#Footnote_34" class="fnanchor">[34]</a></p>

<p>I must regret that Prendergast has not explained the origin,
so obscurely hinted at in the ballad, of Whittington's connexion
with the Cat; but it is at the same time a satisfaction
to think, that by the use of the words "would," "could,"
and "should,"&mdash;"likely," "possibly," "probably," and
"naturally," "fancy," "research," "inquiry," and "no
doubt," (the use of which is so admirably displayed by Mr.
Godwin,) I may be enabled to throw some light&mdash;<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">lucem<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">[232]</a></span>
dare ex fumo</i>&mdash;on several dark parts of this difficult
subject.</p>

<p>It can easily be imagined that Whittington, who, with a
truly philanthropic disposition, possessed a mind scantily
cultivated, would naturally have a turn for the marvellous&mdash;indeed,
the preternatural interference of the bells of Bow
steeple (of which a published life of our hero says, there
were then but six),<a name="FNanchor_35" id="FNanchor_35"></a><a href="#Footnote_35" class="fnanchor">[35]</a> with his destiny and the good fortune
resulting from their suggestion, may naturally be supposed
to have favoured his predisposition for the miraculous; and
therefore when he heard from various sources the stories
which were related of the wonderful enchantress in foreign
parts, he was animated and delighted, and having more taste
for female beauty than knowledge of his native language, was
persuaded she was not only the most ill-used personage, but
the most lovely woman on earth, from hearing that,&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<p class="verse">"She was a <em>Charmer</em>, and could almost read</p>
<p class="verse">The thoughts of people"&mdash;&mdash;<a name="FNanchor_36" id="FNanchor_36"></a><a href="#Footnote_36" class="fnanchor">[36]</a></p>
</div></div></div>

<p>Prendergast indeed goes so far as to hint, that Whittington
himself, from the rapid acquirement of his wealth, lay under
the imputation of sorcery, and that he aimed at the attainment
of some secrets from the Enchantress to carry on his
schemes, which was the chief cause of his devotion to her.
The same author says, that he was taxed with concocting
a liquor made from noxious weeds and deadly herbs, with
which he was enabled to steal away men's senses, and lead
them according to his will; but I must be allowed to doubt
the truth of this charge,&mdash;it seems to be a vulgar revival of
the old story of Circe. Looking at the events of his life,
there appears to me abundant proof that Matthew was no
conjuror.</p>

<p>That Prendergast may have been a victim to superstition I
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">[233]</a></span>will not deny&mdash;that he wrote in the full belief of the lady's
preternatural powers is evident; but it is only justice to his
historical veracity to say, that in all his commendations of
her merits, he falls far short of a French author, the Marquis
de St. Cas, who was one of the favourites of Margaret de
Valois, the repudiated wife of Henry the IVth, and who
wrote a History of a Cat, which has hitherto been mistakenly
supposed to be a covert defence of the scandalous life of that
lascivious princess; but which, as it now appears, is a sober
and discreet history of Whittington's Cat.</p>

<p>One singular and interesting fact to be ascertained from
this work, which, let us observe, was not written above two
hundred years after the time, and is therefore entitled to
great credit on the score of tradition, is, that the French
most indubitably allude to the Enchantress we are now
treating of, in their celebrated history of <em>The White Cat</em>,
which indeed to me appears little other than a version of
Whittington's adventures, the English origin of which, that
vain and disingenuous people have as carefully suppressed as
they since have that of the guillotine&mdash;wash-hand basons&mdash;the
steam engine&mdash;snaffle bridles, and the telegraph.<a name="FNanchor_37" id="FNanchor_37"></a><a href="#Footnote_37" class="fnanchor">[37]</a></p>

<p>In the Marquis's book may be found recorded the exaggerated
accounts of the Enchantress, which were zealously
circulated in her own times by the French, and which inflamed
and animated Matthew; St. Cas most gallantly repeats
(as if he believed) all the praises which his forefathers had
lavished upon her, and pictures her as the most fascinating
being on earth, so condescending in her manners that the
lowest orders of society were more readily admitted to her
confidence and acquaintance than those of noble birth and
superior qualifications, and of a disposition so forgiving, that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">[234]</a></span>
if she could anyhow light upon men (no matter who) who
had been the creatures and favoured followers of any person
or family who from time immemorial had been the bitterest
enemies of her house and the country she most loved, these
were the particular objects of her care and protection&mdash;for
those were all her powers exerted, the magic of all her
charms displayed. This predilection for the destroyers of
her relations, the Marquis adduces as one of the most amiable
traits of "<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">La belle Sorcière.</span>"</p>

<p>And here again we are presented with a confirmation of
Mr. Backhouse's hypothesis, that all the vulgar mistaken
notions about this great lady are occasioned by errors of
the press; for in the first edition of St. Cas (Lyons, 1609) the
word <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">sorcière</i> is printed <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">souricière</i>, which means, as the
learned reader well knows, "a mouse-catcher."</p>

<p>Perhaps, however, the printer may not be wholly to blame
on this point, inasmuch as the Marquis himself distinctly
alludes to her having assumed the form of a Cat, which he
seems to consider a state of honour&mdash;"The Cat," says he,
"is a privileged animal;" and then proceeds to narrate the
following story in support of his assertion:&mdash;</p>

<p>"<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Mahomet avoit beaucoup d'égards pour son Chat.&mdash;Ce
vénérable animal s'était un jour couché sur la manche pendante
de la veste du Prophète, et semblait y mediter si profondément
que Mahomet pressé de se rendre à la Prière, et
n'osant le tirer de son extase, coupa la manche de sa veste.
A son retour, il trouva son chat qui revenait de son assoupissement
extatique, et que s'appercevant de l'attention de son
maître à la vue de la manche coupée, se leva, pour lui faire
la revérénce, dressa la queue, et plia le dos en arc, pour lui
témoigner plus de respect. Mahomet qui comprit à merveille
ce que cela signifiait, assura au saint homme de chat
une place dans son Paradis. Ensuite lui passant trois fois la
main sur le dos, il lui imprima, par cet attouchement, la vertu
de ne jamais tomber que sur ses pates.</span>"</p>

<p>Hence the Marquis argues, that his favourite Enchantress<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">[235]</a></span>
did by no means degrade or bemean herself by the abandonment
of her character as a woman, if it were to answer any
sufficient purpose she assumed that of a Cat.</p>

<p>The accounts which tradition brought down to the Marquis's
time, and has even to our own, would naturally have
spread from mouth to mouth all through Europe, at the time
when facts so surprising occurred; and Whittington was one
of those men who are disposed to believe every thing they
do not rightly comprehend, the consequence of which disposition
was his almost boundless credulity, and after inflaming
his mind with the descriptions of the Enchantress,
and the implied restraint under which she laboured, he resolved
(from what motive nobody has completely succeeded
in discovering) to induce her to visit England.</p>

<p>It is concluded, that a desire for notoriety had no weight
with him in this resolution, for never did any man of his
time shrink from the applause of the vulgar with such
delicate sensibility as Whittington. Hearing his own name
spoken aloud in the streets, caused him the greatest uneasiness,
and he was moved to anger if any wandering minstrels
who were singing his praises, chanced to pass near his residence.</p>

<p>This is stated by Ibbotson (before quoted), and is highly
satisfactory, inasmuch as the general impression upon the
minds of all those versed in the history, was that most of the
little songs of which he was the hero were written either in
his house or at least at his suggestion. The friend who
favoured me with the copy of the ballad quoted above
has furnished me with two stanzas of another, which he
found in the same volume, and which proves that Ibbotson's
account of Matthew's modesty is perfectly just, for his
indifference about, not to say dislike to, popularity (as it
is called) was so strong, that such of his partisans as
chose to celebrate him in poetry were, in compliance with
his scrupulous wishes, compelled to designate him by the
initials of his name.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">[236]</a></span></p>

<div class="poetry-containerx"><div class="poetry antiqua">

<p class="verse4">Long lyfe to Matthewe W.</p>
</div></div></div>

<p>With this proof of his retiring disposition we are the more
puzzled in looking at his conduct with respect to the Great
Lady, because really, if we had not such powerful evidence
as Ibbotson and others have adduced, one could hardly fancy
any other incitement to her introduction into the country,
than an officious desire to be meddling with things which
did not at all concern him, for the mere sake of creating a
sensation, of withdrawing the attention of his countrymen
from the pursuit of their occupations, to the idle speculation
of star-gazing and conjuring, and, in short, of making himself
at any rate the Hero of a Story, by which his name
might go down to posterity. In this he has certainly
succeeded; but the price he has paid for notoriety appears
(considering how he disliked it) to have been rather high.</p>

<p>One circumstance has been mentioned, as having probably
given his disposition a turn, which is this: the Countess of
Mountfort, or as she is called, Jane of Flanders, had visited
England about five or six years before the period at which
Whittington undertook his renowned expedition. This extraordinary
woman, roused by the captivity of a husband to
whom she was faithfully attached, had quitted the confined
circle of domestic life, to which she was an ornament, and
risked everything in the cause of her beloved Count: her
party, however (spite of her personal success), declining on
every side, she came to London, to solicit succours from the
King of England, and to the reception she met with from the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">[237]</a></span>
populace, and the praises bestowed on Sir Walter Manny,
who suggested her appeal to the British Court, is by very
many persons attributed the anxiety of Whittington to introduce
his Cat or lady to the notice of the people.</p>

<p>But a much more probable account is suggested by the old
ballad, and indeed countenanced by other authorities, namely,
that a certain knavish lawyer who had, by some means, now
unknown, and probably at no time very avowable, got about
the Cat, and became intimately connected with all her secrets
and mysteries whatever they were, had contrived to get the
Cat into a bag, and so far from letting her out of the bag,
as she and her followers no doubt expected, he is supposed
to have formed the base design of selling the Cat to her
enemies.</p>

<p>This account would naturally rouse the indignation of a
man, even less high-minded than the illustrious Whittington,
who combining, like many modern citizens, generosity with
an eye to profit, justly considered that if the Cat were worth
anything, he might as well have the gain as the lawyer;
and with this magnanimous intention he resolved to get
possession of the Cat. Not very much, it would appear,
knowing or caring, in the blindness of his enthusiasm,
whether she was a Cat or a witch; a great lady, or the devil.</p>

<p>What she really was, appeared afterwards, when the bag
came to be opened.<a name="FNanchor_38" id="FNanchor_38"></a><a href="#Footnote_38" class="fnanchor">[38]</a></p>

<p>The <em>zealous</em> desire of possessing at all events this demi-human
personage, made Whittington quite careless of the
consequences of his blind bargain. He anticipated advantages
to himself from exhibiting her, which (probably from
the apprehension of being laughed at) he never ventured to
mention to his nearest friends; a gentle hint on the subject
thrown out to his better and bigger half, was received by her
with all the rapture one might expect an obscure person to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">[238]</a></span>
express at the prospect of becoming notorious; for though
certain it is that Matthew's views and desires throughout the
whole business were untinctured by the smallest wish for
<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">éclat</i> or distinction, we are not prepared to say that his wife
might not have cast a longing eye towards the Enchantress's
banquets and gaieties, of which such splendid accounts had
been given, or that her ambition (for these sort of people are
ambitious in their sphere) might not have led her to hope
that by the aid of the great lady's magic, her daughter (who
had been some time on hand) might attain such an accession
either of real property or personal attraction, as might get her
respectably established in life.</p>

<p>For the means of carrying his plan into execution quietly
and securely, Matthew had recourse to a stratagem, which,
although, under the circumstances, perfectly fair, to him was
eminently distressing, for the exquisite sensibility with which
he shrunk from anything like disguise&mdash;equivocation&mdash;mis-statement,
or deviation from the plain fact, had obtained for
him the appellation of honest Whittington; and to maintain
his claim to that honourable distinction, was the constant
effort of his life.</p>

<p>The stratagem which he adopted is stated to have been
this:&mdash;It will be recollected, that at the period of which we
treat, the staple of wool, leather, and lead was fixed at Calais
whither all foreigners were specially invited to traffic, and
whence no English merchant was permitted to export English
goods. The intercourse between this port and Dover at the
first institution of this mart was frequent and general.
Thither went Whittington as on a mercantile speculation.</p>

<p>In the various histories of our hero considerable confusion
appears to have arisen at this point. The majority
of the innumerable authorities which I have quoted in my
large work, I think bear me out in declaring that Whittington
actually saw his commodity before he brought it to England,
and that it assumed the appearance of a woman in order to
deceive him.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">[239]</a></span></p>

<p>The difficulty of deciding arises from the improbability that
a great lady should so suddenly have abandoned the guidance
of her counsellors, who (as they were paid for it) were bound
to give her proper advice, and put herself under the care of
a "feu Lord Maire;" but that difficulty is met by the consideration
that Matthew's eloquence was very celebrated in
his day, and that, as his mind was set upon bringing over the
prodigy, he doubtlessly exerted its whole force and energy in
representing to her the respectability which would infallibly
attach itself to her through the rest of her life, from the
circumstance of her having been brought into the capital of
England under the immediate protection of a man renowned
as he was both in his mercantile and political character, and
whose important station in the country was so well suited to
the introduction of such a personage.</p>

<p>Add to his arguments, his conduct on the occasion; and
our surprise at her complying with his wishes will be materially
diminished. Could a woman of sense and feeling
refuse to throw herself into the care of the man, who, with
that wonderful intrepidity and almost incredible presence of
mind, which obtained for him the appellation of the <em>brave</em>
Whittington, ventured his existence for upwards of three hours
and a half upon the water, and undertook a voyage of nearly
thirty-two miles (starting late in the evening), in a vessel of
not more than one hundred and seventy tons burthen, for
her sake! an enterprise which, though in these enlightened
days we might be inclined to ridicule, was in those times
considered the most surprisingly valorous feat ever compassed
by an Alderman.<a name="FNanchor_39" id="FNanchor_39"></a><a href="#Footnote_39" class="fnanchor">[39]</a></p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">[240]</a></span></p>
<p>As for the Cat, whatever shape she took (and there can be
little doubt, as my readers will hereafter see, which form she
really did assume), she suffered not much from the effects of
the water carriage. She had been a great traveller in her
time, and, amongst other good company into which she had
fallen during her progresses, had been admitted into the
Serail at Algiers, where, according to an old poem, it appears,
she</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<p class="verse">"Passed herre tyme amydst ye throng,</p>
<p class="verse">As happie as ye deye was long."<a name="FNanchor_40" id="FNanchor_40"></a><a href="#Footnote_40" class="fnanchor">[40]</a></p>
</div></div></div>

<p>Nevertheless, Whittington, after he had been in her society
for a short time, began to doubt (as well he might) her
supernatural powers. He argued, from a knowledge of the
sex's little weaknesses, that if she had had the ability to have
assumed any form she had chosen, she doubtlessly would
have adopted a more agreeable one than that which she
actually appeared under; but then, on the other hand, he
contended with himself, that by as much as her real claims
upon notice and attention were weak and groundless, by so
much must her magic be potent, for that unless the Devil
himself had taken possession of the rabble (at her instigation)
they never could have seen anything to admire or respect
about her.</p>

<p>Still, however, with that good taste so perceptible in all
his conduct, Matthew, in order to keep up the dignity of his
Enchantress, and to induce spectators to respect her, never
ventured to approach her without the most marked actions<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">[241]</a></span>
of humility, never would be covered in her presence, nor
treat her with less deference than though she had been a
queen.<a name="FNanchor_41" id="FNanchor_41"></a><a href="#Footnote_41" class="fnanchor">[41]</a></p>

<p>The more Matthew began to doubt her powers, and to
suspect he had been in some sort duped, the more he raved
about the excellent qualities of his great Lady&mdash;Penthesilea,
with all her "magna virtutis documenta" at her back, was
not fit to be named in the same day with her. Berenice,
Camilla, Zenobia, Valasca the Bohemian, or Amelasunta,
queen of the Ostrogoths, had neither fortitude, nor temperance,
nor chastity, nor any good qualities to put in competition
with hers. And as for the modern ladies, your
Laura Bossis or Victoria Accarambonis, or even the renowned
Donna Maria Pacheco, Bianca Hedwig, Lady of Duke Henry
the beardy of Ligniz, they would have been considered the
small fry, the mere white-bait of the sex, compared with
Whittington's Enchantress.<a name="FNanchor_42" id="FNanchor_42"></a><a href="#Footnote_42" class="fnanchor">[42]</a> Matthew daily grew more and
more uneasy about his charge: instead of aspiring to dignity,
or performing any of those astonishing feats which he expected,
she appeared addicted to vulgar habits and coarse
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">[242]</a></span>pleasures, attracted no respectable admirers, and passed her
time in obscure corners, choosing either woods or barns for
her lurking-places, to which she was followed only by the
very lowest of the rabble.</p>

<p>It was a matter of delicacy with Matthew not to hint
that he should be glad to see some proof of her powers, for
by the murmurs which he heard, in bettermost life, he apprehended
that the Legislature would interfere, in order to put a
stop to her imposition.</p>

<p>Matthew now stood in a very awkward situation: he had
brought an unwelcome object into England, contrary to the
advice of all those about her, and in direct opposition to the
feelings of all the respectable part of the community, and had,
in fact, drawn himself into the disagreeable certainty of being
wrong under all circumstances.</p>

<p>If she really were what he boasted her to be, he was
amenable to the laws, which, as Blackstone says, both before
and since the Conquest, have been equally severe, ranking the
crime of sorcery and of those who consult sorcerers in the
same class with heresy, and condemning both to the flames.
If she were not, he had foisted a deception upon the mob,
which they never would forgive.</p>

<p>This he knew, and therefore felt his full share of agreeable
sensations arising from the alternative, which presented itself
of being burned alive in one case, and universally laughed at
in the other; not but that it must be allowed that Mr. W.
possessed amongst other characteristics of fortitude, a surprisingly
stoical callousness to ridicule.</p>

<p>His apprehensions about the interference of the Legislature
were by no means groundless. It was evidently necessary
to open the eyes of the country to the flagrant imposition
which was carrying on, and to which poor Whittington most
innocently and unintentionally had made himself a party.
The <em>brave</em> man, however, began to feel a few fears, which had
hitherto been strangers to his <em>great</em> heart: testimonies of his
enchantress's charlatanerie were forthcoming from every<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">[243]</a></span>
quarter, of which she was perfectly aware, but advised
Matthew to put a good face upon the matter and brave it out,
assuring him, that if it came to evidence, she could produce a
great many more witnesses of her innocence than her opponents
could bring forward of her guilt.</p>

<p>This mode of exculpation has been recorded by a very
popular writer of much later days.<a name="FNanchor_43" id="FNanchor_43"></a><a href="#Footnote_43" class="fnanchor">[43]</a> He relates an anecdote
where a murder was clearly proved against a prisoner by the
concurrent testimony of seven witnesses: when the culprit
was called on for his defence, he complained of want of
evidence against him; for, said he, "My Lord and Gentlemen
of the Jury, you lay great stress upon the production of
seven persons who swear that they saw me commit the crime.
If that be all, I will produce you seven times as many who
will swear that they did not see me do it." Much on a par
with this was the favourable evidence on which this eminent
piece of injured innocence relied for exculpation.<a name="FNanchor_44" id="FNanchor_44"></a><a href="#Footnote_44" class="fnanchor">[44]</a></p>

<p>The most singular part of the story is, that with all
Matthew's well-known intelligence, good sense, prudence,
amiability, and virtue, his zeal got the better of his consistency.
He and his friends who most warmly espoused the
cause of the great impostor, were those who from time
immemorial had upheld the democracy of the constitution,
had rung the changes upon all the virtuous attributes of low
life, "Honest Poverty," and "The Sovereignty of the
People;" but, strange to say, in their excessive zeal for their
new idol, these equalizing politicians decided unanimously,
that all the witnesses who were to prove her misdeeds, were
perjured villains and infamous rogues, even before they had
said a syllable on the subject, because, forsooth, they were
poor and shabbily clothed, as if a line coat were essential to
truth and justice, or that a poor man could not speak truth.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">[244]</a></span></p>

<p>Now really to me their poverty (if one may judge by the
accounts which have been handed down of them,) appears
one of the strongest proofs of their honesty; for, had they
been tampered with as Whittington insinuated, it is not improbable
that some part of their earnings would have been
expended in the purchase of such habits as might at least
have protected them from insult in the streets.</p>

<p>There was one objection to their evidence, which, inasmuch
as it is patriotic, is honourable&mdash;they were foreigners,
and therefore not to be believed.&mdash;&mdash;Now, touching the justice
of this sweeping decision much may be said; and it is by no
means unpleasing to see that even in these days there is still
a national prejudice against foreign habits and manners; the
looseness of conduct, and general want of delicacy of
the continental nations, are at variance with the pure and
better regulated habits of our countrymen and countrywomen;
and in Whittington's days it clearly appears that morality had
so firmly established itself in England, that a foreigner was
not to be credited on oath.</p>

<p>In the instance of this nondescript lady, this feeling
certainly had not so much weight as it might have had in
many others, nor was the expression of it over-gallant,
considering that she herself was a foreigner and educated, if
St. Cas and other authors are to be believed, in one of the
most licentious schools of continental incontinence.</p>

<p>One strong argument against the credibility of these
persons was the general venality of all the natives of the
country they came from, which was so flagrant that a man
might be bought for five shillings to swear any thing. The
witnesses which the Cat lady intended, it appears, to produce
in her defence, were all from the same nation&mdash;this objection,
unfortunately for her, tells both ways.</p>

<p>Be that as it may, it appears pretty evident, that at the
period to which I am now alluding Whittington, whether
voluntarily or not I cannot pretend to determine, was separated
from the object of all his hopes and fears;&mdash;indeed, how<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">[245]</a></span>
the separation between them was brought about has puzzled
all who have hitherto considered the subject: some writers
suppose that she never had any superior or supernatural
powers, but that she was altogether an impostor, others
positively maintain (particularly one) that she was a person
of prudence, wisdom, delicacy, and virtue.<a name="FNanchor_45" id="FNanchor_45"></a><a href="#Footnote_45" class="fnanchor">[45]</a></p>

<p>Those who deny her existence at <em>any time</em> in human shape
are by no means few; amongst their number is, as we have
seen, my excellent friend Doctor Snodgrass: these aver with
every appearance of truth, that she was neither more nor less
than a domestic cat, but that she was stolen from Whittington
by the monks of the monastery "<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Sancti Stephani apud
Westmonasteriensis</i>," for the purpose of catching certain great
rats which infested their chapel and the adjoining house, and
that the poor Alderman cut a very ridiculous figure when
deprived of his favourite raree-show.</p>

<p>Some, on the other hand, incline to believe that Mr.
Whittington got sick of his bargain, and assert that what
with caterwauling and bringing crowds of followers into the
gutters of his residence, she turned out to be so troublesome
an inmate, that he got rid of her as soon as he could, and
prevailed on an old maid in the neighbourhood to take care
of her.<a name="FNanchor_46" id="FNanchor_46"></a><a href="#Footnote_46" class="fnanchor">[46]</a></p>

<p>For me, however, till now, has been reserved the important,
the enviable task of unravelling all the mysteries in which
this subject has been hitherto involved. To me it is granted
to reconcile all contending opinions, and to simplify all the
difficulties which have baffled my predecessors in the attainment
of truth. I am enabled, as I firmly believe, beyond the
power of contradiction, to declare to the world <em>who</em> the Cat
was, and <em>what</em> she was. I am competent to display in its
true colours the character of Mr. Matthew Whittington, to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">[246]</a></span>illustrate and make clear his views, his motives, and the other
eight points which I have before noticed to be in dispute,
even to the cause and nature of his death, an event hitherto
equally obscure with his birth.</p>

<p>Gifted as I am with this power to illuminate the literary
world, is it not natural that I should feel anxious to make
use of it for their advantage? One consideration alone
checks me in my desire to afford the purchasers of this
Tentamen all the information I possess; that consideration I
trust I shall not be censured for attending to. I confess it is
a prudential one, inasmuch as were I in this small specimen
to give my readers all the details, narratives, and general
information I possess, I am apprehensive that the work itself
would not meet with that encouragement which is at present
promised, and which alone can repay me for the labour of
years, and that ceaseless anxiety which an undertaking so
diffusely elaborate naturally has entailed upon its author.</p>

<h3>MR. WARD'S ALLEGORICAL PICTURE OF
WATERLOO.<a name="FNanchor_47" id="FNanchor_47"></a><a href="#Footnote_47" class="fnanchor">[47]</a></h3>


<p>We have the highest respect for the arts and for artists;
we are perfectly aware of the numerous qualifications requisite
for a painter&mdash;we know and feel the difficulty, and
duly consider the quantity of talent necessary to the painting
even of a bad picture. The years of probationary labour
expended before even the palette comes into use, the days
and nights of watching, and toil after it is assumed, and the
variety of chemical, mechanical, and scientific knowledge
which must be brought to bear upon a subject before the idea
of the painter can be transferred to the canvas.</p>

<p>These feelings, and this respect for the art, and professors
of painting, make us slow to censure; and, although we have
long had our eyes upon some of the public exhibitions of the
season, we have refrained from commenting upon them till
the common curiosity of the town had repaid, in some measure,
the care and anxiety of those in whose studies they had their
origin.</p>

<p>Mr. Haydon, a sonnet-writing Cockney, ranking high in
the administration of the smoky kingdom of Cockaigne,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250">[250]</a></span>
distinguished himself last year, by exhibiting a picture of the
"Entry into Jerusalem," which, like Tom Thumb's Cow,
was "larger than the largest size." Elated with the success
of this immense performance, (of which one group only was
at all finished,) Mr. Haydon, this year, put forth a work
representing "the Agony in the Garden:" the divine subject
saved the silly artist, and we were upon that account
silent; else, for Mr. Haydon, who wears his shirt collars
open, and curls his hair in long ringlets, because Rafaele
did so, and who, if it did not provokingly turn down over
his mouth, would turn up his nose at the Royal Academy,
indeed we should have felt very little tenderness.</p>

<p>But with respect to Mr. Ward's allegorical picture of
Waterloo, we had different feelings&mdash;the picture had good
principle about it, and the weeks, months, and years which
have been bestowed upon it demanded some recompense; the
idlers of Piccadilly did not feel the occasional disbursement
of a shilling. In pleasant society Ward's exhibition-room
was as good a place wherein to "laugh a sultry hour away"
as any other; and anxious that Mr. Ward, after having expended
so much time, canvas, and colour, should get something
by it, we have patiently let him draw his reward from
the pockets of those good easy folks, who read newspaper
puffs and believe them; and who go and vow all over London
that a picture is wonderful and sublime, merely because the
painter, at the trifling charge of seven shillings and sixpence,
has thought proper to tell them that it is so, in the public
journals.</p>

<p>But when we find that this picture was painted for the
directors of the British Institution, founded "for the express
purpose of encouraging the Fine Arts," and is about to be
engraved and disseminated throughout the country, as a
specimen of the works taken under the especial care of that
Institution; it really becomes a duty to save the nation from
a charge of bad taste so heavy as must arise out of the
patronage of such a ludicrous daub.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251">[251]</a></span></p>

<p>This may be a picture painted for the Institution at their
desire, and the execution of it is no proof of their want of
judgment, because they desired to have such a picture, and
they have got it, and we have thereby no proof of their
approbation; but since they have got themselves into a
scrape, they certainly should not allow a print to be made
from it, even if they suffer the painting to remain in
existence.</p>

<p>If it be possible to imagine one thing upon earth more
irresistibly ridiculous than another, it is the composition of
this enormous thing&mdash;the size of it is thirty-five feet by
twenty-one&mdash;in the centre appears the Duke of Wellington in
a pearl car&mdash;under his feet are legs and arms, and heads in
glorious confusion&mdash;before him rides a pretty little naked boy
upon a lion&mdash;over him in the clouds are a group of young
gentlemen with wings, representing the Duke's victories,
who look like Mrs. Wilkinson's Preparatory Academy turned
out for a bathe; and amongst these pretty little dears are
Peace and Plenty, and a great angel overshadowing the
whole party.</p>

<p>But this very absurd jumble (at which, through a little hole,
Blucher and Platoff are looking with some surprise,) is by
no means the most ludicrous part of the affair&mdash;in the clouds
are two persons, called by Mr. Ward, Ignorance and Error,
(one of whom has a dirty handkerchief tied over his eyes,)
beneath whom are dogs' heads with wings&mdash;a tipsy-looking
cock-eyed owl trampling a heavy stone Osiris into the earth&mdash;a
little calf without a head&mdash;a red night-cap&mdash;a watchman's
rattle&mdash;an old crow&mdash;Paine's "Rights of Man"&mdash;Voltaire's
works, a sick harpy&mdash;a devil sucking his fingers&mdash;a hobby-horse's
head, and a heap of chains&mdash;here is the allegory&mdash;all
of which we shall attempt to explain in Mr. Ward's own
words, for he is an author as well as a painter, and, absurd
as are the productions of his pencil, the nonsense of his pen
is, of the two, the most exquisite.</p>

<p>In the foreground of the picture is a skeleton evidently<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252">[252]</a></span>
afflicted with the head-ache, before whom runs a little wide-mouthed
waddling frog with a long tail, and beyond these a
group which defies description.</p>

<p>The horses (particularly the near wheeler) have a very
droll and cunning expression about the eye; but the four
persons leading them, whether considered as to their drawing
or colouring, are beneath all criticism: a pupil of six
months' standing ought to have been flogged for doing anything
so bad.</p>

<p>In short, the whole thing in its kind closely resembles the
overgrown transparencies painted to be stuck up at Vauxhall,
or the Cumberland Gardens, or for public rejoicings, and
ought, as soon as it has answered its purpose like those, be
obliterated, and the stuff worked up for something else.</p>

<p>In a book published upon this performance, Mr. Ward
modestly says, that he is not ambitious to be considered an
author, and adds, that there exists some insuperable objection
to his ever being one; but still, he professes to attempt in
his own simple style an explanation of his own ideas. He
feels quite confident of public favour and indulgence, and
then gives us his view of the thing:&mdash;as a specimen of this
said style, we shall quote his notions about envy&mdash;its beauty,
we confess, is evident&mdash;its simplicity we are afraid is somewhat
questionable.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>"Where shall we find a safe retreat for envied greatness, from the
miry breath or slander's feverish tongue; dark in the bosom of the
ocean's fathomless abyss, on the cloud-cleaving Atlas, or at the extremity
of east or west. High on the gilded dome, or palace pinnacle,
should merit's fairest hard-earned honours shine, once seated there, the
sickly eye of speckled Jealousy, or Envy's snaky tribe, with iron nerve,
and cold in blood, well scan the mark, and the envenomed javelin cast,
with secret but unerring aim, and what is to screen him from the foul
attack? The shield of Worth intrinsic, bound about with truth, and
conscious innocence, and where that lives, all other covering only tends
to hide its blushing beauties from the rising sun, and dim the face of
day.</p>

<p>"So the firm oak's deep roots, eccentric, winding through the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253">[253]</a></span>
heaving earth, fast bound and chasmed deep, with many a widening
gap, by blazing Sol's mid ray, at summer's sultry noon, opposes strength
to strength; or round the impervious rocks, in weighty balance to its
broad branch, and highly-lifted head, up to the mountain's summit,
shrinks not from the prospect of the blackening storm, and while it
sends its sweeping arms around over the circling numerous acres,
shadowing under its expanded greatness, fears not the threatening blast,
nor for protection looks to man. Too great to need a screen; it were
children's play to throw a mantle over its full broad majesty, to try to
save its foliage luxuriant from the rude element. The attempt would
be as weedy muslin's cobweb insipidity; its flimsy partial covering would
only hide its full matured richness; and the first breeze of whirlwind's
opening rising tempest, tear from the disdainful surface to streaming
raggedness the feeble effort, and open to the eye the golden fruit,
freshening by the tempest, and glittering in the storm."</p></div>

<p>We know very little of human nature, if Mr. Ward, in
spite of his disclaiming any wish to be considered as an
author, does not think all this very fine. By way of simply
explaining his allegory, it is particularly useful;&mdash;of Mr.
Ward's view of the necessity of such explanation we may
assure ourselves by his very apposite allusion to Milton,
Walter Scott, Homer, and Burn (as he calls him). This
paragraph we must quote:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>"It is contended by some, that a picture should be made up only of
such materials as are capable of telling its own story; such confinement
would shut out the human mind from a depth of pursuit in every
branch of art. Poetry requires prose fully to explain its meaning, and
to create an interest; for who would be without the notes in Walter
Scott's 'Lay of the Last Minstrel,' or a glossary to the poems of
Burn, the argument to Milton or Homer? If then it be necessary to
make use of language to explain poetry, should not the same medium be
used to explain personification? It has been thought necessary on the
stage to send a person between the acts as a comment on the past, and
a preface to the future, and can we, I ask, understand what is going on
even in nature, by dumb show? If we see a crowd of people assembled
in the streets, do we expect that the action and expression should inform
us the cause of their congregating in an unusual manner? Experience
proves more than volumes of argument. We ask 'what does all this
mean?'"</p></div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_254" id="Page_254">[254]</a></span></p>

<p>To which we most candidly reply, we really do not
know.</p>

<p>Mr. Ward then proceeds in the following manner:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>"Wellington has his hand upon the tri-coloured cross, on the shield
of Britannia, expressive of the Christian's <ins class="corr" title="Transcriber's Note&mdash;Original text: '  blem'">emblem</ins>, and the three
colours of which it is composed are the colours answerable to the three
principles in Trinity!!!</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<p class="verse">Red is the first fiery principle in the Godhead;</p>
<p class="verse">Blue the second in the Saviour, or Mediator;</p>
<p class="verse">White the third in the Dove of Peace."</p>
</div></div></div></div>

<p>This ingenious explanation of the mysteries of the Union
Jack must be highly satisfactory to every thinking Englishman:
there is, indeed, but one drawback to the holy
pleasure we feel at Mr. Ward's sublime discovery, which
is, that the Revolutionary flag of France was composed of
the same three colours.</p>

<p>The enlightened artist then informs us&mdash;speaking of
Britannia, "that the twisted lock of hair <em>laying</em> in front
upon her bosom, and over the right arm, is emblematic
of"&mdash;what do you suppose, reader?&mdash;"of the spirit of
justice."</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>"Justice, stern and unrelenting, whose sword is forward, and whose
plaited hair is answerable to that sword, and makes in the person of
Justice the number three, as expressive of the Trinity, or the whole of
Godhead manifested in the awful administration of justice. That
sword is serpentine, as expressive of flame, Deity in its principle of
fire."</p></div>

<p>This is "finely confused, and very alarming;" but
observe:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>"With the other hand she points through the medium of the Trident
to the Trinity in Unity, commanding him to look up to Providence as
alone able to give success to his efforts."</p></div>

<p>This puzzles us; pointing through the medium of "the
Trident" appears to us to be something like looking at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_255" id="Page_255">[255]</a></span>
the Sun through the medium of a toasting-fork; but we
may be wrong.</p>

<p>Mr. Ward then continues:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>"The cat and broken spear are emblems of rebellion and anarchy."&mdash;P. 11.</p>

<p>"The British Lion is majestically observing the effects of his own
operations; his countenance shows no symptom of the reign of passion&mdash;anger
is alone signified by the movement of his tail."</p></div>

<p>For this illustration of natural history Mr. Ward appears
to be indebted to Mathews, who, in his "At Home,"
told a capital story of a showman and one of the noble
beasts in question, in which, while his head is in the
lion's mouth, he anxiously inquires of a by-stander, "Doth
he wag his tail?" That bit of waggery being indicative
(as Mr. Ward has comically painted it) of the ire of lions
generally.</p>

<p>Mr. Ward, as matter of information, tells us, page 19,
that "the palm-tree grows to the height of five hundred
feet, and bears the date and cocoa-nut." What date the
trees Mr. Ward alludes to might have borne we cannot
say; but certain it is, that modern palms have left off
growing to the height of five hundred feet; which, considering
it to be about three times the height of the Monument,
and one hundred feet more than the height of St.
Paul's, is not so very surprising.</p>

<p>The following information, conveyed in page 20, is likely
to be very interesting from its importance:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>"Juvenile antagonists in the streets dare not strike an unfair blow,
take the other by the hair, or maltreat him when fallen upon the
ground. In such case, he not only loses his battle, but also&mdash;his
character!!!"</p></div>

<p>At page 22 we have, perhaps, the most finished description
of docking a horse that ever was put to paper; it is somewhat
lengthy, but it will repay the lover of the sublime for
his trouble in reading it:&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_256" id="Page_256">[256]</a></span></p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>"Can any thing be so far from true taste, as to round the ears of
a dog, or to cut them off; whatever may be the beauty, breed, or character,
to cut off the thumb, or fifth toe, and call it a Dew claw, and
consider it of no use! To chop off the tail of a waggon-horse, so necessary
and useful to that class of creature; above all, to separate every
joint of the tail, with all the misery attending upon it, in order to
reverse the order of Nature, and make that turn up which ought to
turn down, all equally show the want of taste, as the want of humanity?
Who has ever witnessed the operation last alluded to, if not, pause; and
in your imagination, behold a nobly-formed, and finely-tempered creature,
led from the stable in all the pride of health, and all the playful
confidence of being led out, and held by his master and his friend, view
the hobbles fastened to his legs, his feet drawn to a point, and himself
cast to the earth, so contrary to his expectations and his hopes; observe
the commencement, and the lingering process; behold the wreathing of
the lovely and as useful animal; how does his heaving breast manifest
his astonishment, while his greatly oppressed and labouring heart beats
high with resentment, at being thus tampered. His quivering flesh
sends through every pore streams of sweat; his open nostrils are bursting
with agony of body and spirit, while his strained eye-balls flash as
with the fixed glare of expiring nature. Heard you that groan? poor
animal. They have began the deed of barbarism! he faintly shrieks,
'tis as the piteous cry of the timid hare, when sinking under the deadly
gripe of the fierce, agile, and ravenous greyhound. How he grinds his
teeth, and bores his tightly-twitched and twisted lip, and smoking
nostril, into the thick litter, or grovelling, rubs his aching forehead into
the loose sand; now the sudden and convulsive effort! what a struggle!
every nerve, sinew, tendon, stretched to its full bearing, with fearful
energy! Oh! that he could now disencumber his fettered limbs, and
spring from his tormentors. Those limbs, that would joyfully bound
over the broad plain, or patient bear the cumbrous load, nor utter one
complaint in the deep toil; or drag with unwearied submission, harnessed,
galled, and parched with thirst, the lumbering machine to the
very borders of his opening tomb. He groans again, the struggle's over,
and he again lays down; while the hoarse breathing and his panting
sides, prove that all his energies, his mighty energies, have failed: and
the work goes on, still continues, and now another and another gash,
and now the iron hook, to tear out from among the separated complicated
bones, the tenacious ligament that binds the strong vertebræ; and lastly
the burning steel to staunch the streaming blood. Tedious process!&mdash;but
at length it ceases, and the noble, towering, majestic steed is led
back, tottering, trembling, reeling, and dejected, to repose apparently in
peace; but ah! another torment, the cord, the weight, the pulley, day o'er<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_257" id="Page_257">[257]</a></span>
day, and week after week, to keep the lips of the gaping, throbbing,
aching wounds asunder, to close no more for ever. Enough! enough!
our country's shame, for cruelty is not our natural character, our country's
vice."</p></div>

<p>We by no means intend to ridicule Mr. Ward's humanity;
but, we confess, as throwing lights upon an allegorical
picture of the Duke of Wellington's triumphs, we do not
consider the passage quite as much to the purpose as it
might be.</p>

<p>At page 29, Mr. Ward states (and with every appearance
of believing it) that "Cicero was once a lisping infant, and
Sampson, at one period, could not go alone;"&mdash;to which
assertions we must beg to add, for Mr. Ward's satisfaction,
that "Rome was not built in a day."</p>

<p>In his simple style, at page 30, Mr. Ward, speaking of
ignorance, says,&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>"Loose veins of thought, imaginative intellects, evaporation. As the
school-boy's frothy bubble, rising from the turbid elements" soap and
water, "its inflated globule exhibits in proud mimicry the Rainbow's
gaily painted hues, and calls rude mirth to dance upon its glittering
surface, when suddenly it bursts, and all is gone!"</p></div>

<p>We shall conclude our extracts from this explanatory
pamphlet with the following:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>"<span class="smcap">Shapeless Forms of Death.</span>&mdash;Perhaps no part of picturesque representation
is so difficult as this. The poet here has much the advantage.
Ossian may, by a language all understand, throw the imagination into a
delirium, and there leave it bewildered and wandering, in all the confusion
of material immateriality; but in painting it is necessary to give
a substantial shape to a shapeless form, and substance to a vision. It
is not for him to give the ghost of my father as a misty cloud covering
a whole mountain, or enlarging itself to the broad expanse of the capacious
plain, like the flaky layers of a thick fog, on the opening dawn of
a mist-dispersing sunbeam. But the painter must embody disembodied
beings, and give 'to airy nothingness a local habitation and a name.'
Here the various shapes of blood and carnage are to be contemplated,
in the imagery depicted, as cannon-balls, bomb-shells, fiery rockets,
swords, spears, and bayonets, with all the horrible effects of their opera<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_258" id="Page_258">[258]</a></span>tions;
as moving in the conflicted elements; from the head of death's
gloomy tribes, the large death-bat, under the arm of the fell monster
Death, who is grinning with savage pleasure at the havoc he is making.
The monsters are breathing fire, and from their pestiferous dugs dropping
streams of blood, as the milk of their nourishment."</p></div>

<p>Having given some of Mr. Ward's ideas as <ins class="corr" title="Transcriber's Note&mdash;Original text: 'they   written'">they were
written</ins>, we leave those who have not seen his picture to
judge what such ideas must be, upon canvas, with a clumsy
hand, and the worst possible taste.</p>

<p>To say that Mr. Ward is mad, is not what we would
pretend to say; but coupling his painting with the articles
which we have caught and preserved, from his pen, we
must believe that there are many very worthy persons at
present in Bedlam, who could paint allegories full as well,
and describe their meaning afterwards with infinitely more
perspicuity.</p>

<p>All we have to do in this affair is to call upon the Directors
of the British Institution, if they mean to patronise real
merit, or to make their rewards honourable and of value,
to disclaim all approbation of the most illustrious and full-sized
specimen of pictorial Humbug that ever drew shillings
out of the pockets of John Bull.</p>

<p>We have indeed been told that the Institution have (somewhat
too late) discovered that they employed an animal
painter, to paint them an allegorical picture&mdash;they were not
aware of their mistake in the outset; but in order to rectify
it and induce Mr. Ward to rub out his allegory, they have
resolved, it is said, to give him an opportunity of showing his
talents in his own line, by sitting to him for their likenesses,&mdash;it
is added that the portrait of Mr. Richard Payne Knight
is already in a high state of forwardness.</p>

<h3>LETTER FROM A GOOSE.</h3>

<p class="center smcap">To John Bull.</p>

<p class="right small">Farm Yard, Claremont, Friday, Sept. 27, 1822.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sir</span>,&mdash;These are the last words I shall ever have an opportunity
of addressing to you; my doom, alas! is fixed. I am
sentenced to die this evening; neither Alderman Waithman,
nor Mr. Ex-Sheriff Parkins, can save me; I am waiting in
the condemned coop, the <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">coup-de-grace</i> of my illustrious
master's chicken-butcher.</p>

<p>Probably you anticipate the cause of my death: Sunday is
the feast of St. Michael, my blood is required in the mysterious
celebration of the ceremonies observed in all well-regulated
families on that anniversary. This very day twelve-months
my excellent and amiable mother, and my respectable
father, perished on the same account.</p>

<p>At this critical juncture, I pick a quill from one of my
wings to assure you of that resignation to my fate, which I
truly feel:&mdash;that it is not unalloyed, Mr. Bull, I must, however,
confess. Those who know our family know that we are
patriots, that we have souls; and I cannot quit the world
without regretting my future destiny. Brought up, sir, as I
have been; educated upon the English system in the farm-yard
of a Foreign Prince; fattened as I have been at the
public expense; I did expect (as all patriots say they do) that
the sacrifice of my life might have been of some utility to the
country;&mdash;but, alas! no: pampered, fed, stuffed as it were
by anticipation. What is my doom? Am I to be yielded as
a tribute to the nation, whence I have derived my weight and
flavour? Am I to gratify the palate of the illustrious Prince,
my nominal patron? No; I am to be sold and eaten by some
base venal hind in this neighbourhood, who, in these times of
wretchedness, cannot dine on Michaelmas-day without me.</p>

<p>What my sensations are at the treatment I have met with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_260" id="Page_260">[260]</a></span>
you may, perhaps, comprehend. Will you believe it, sir, I
have never seen the illustrious Personage in whose service I
have wasted my days. I have never beheld the amiable
Prince, to whom, for many reasons, I am warmly attached:
first, because I am a goose; secondly, because, thanks to the
generosity of the nation, I am his Royal Highness's goose;
and, thirdly, because I am a goose of high feeling, honour,
and, above all, of gratitude.</p>

<p>What a consolation it would have been to have seen his
Royal countenance!&mdash;what a disgrace to my family to quit
the world without having attained to such a favour! It is
true I have received a great deal of pleasure in the occasional
society of Sir Robert Gardiner, whose attentions have been
very much devoted to our comfort and accommodation in our
Royal Master's absence. I certainly found him in pens;
which, as you know Sir Robert is fond of writing, was no
small return for his civilities&mdash;civilities, which I begin
shrewdly to suspect were, after all, interested, and more insidious
than I apprehend at the moment.</p>

<p>I ought to apologise for trespassing at such length upon
your patience; but, having been for a considerable time a
constant correspondent of the <cite>Morning Chronicle</cite>, I am
habituated to what are vulgarly called long-winded letters;
and when a goose prints his own grievances he is generally
somewhat diffuse. My wrongs are now strongest in my recollection,
and I am anxious that my family reputation should
not suffer in my person, and therefore devote my last moments&mdash;my
last words to you.</p>

<p>If you were a goose, Mr. Editor, how would you bear with
indignities like those I have suffered? Sir, the Heralds' College
could prove, and would prove, if they were sufficiently
well paid for it, that I am lineally descended from the noble
bird who saved the Roman Capitol; and it is in consequence
a common observation amongst the poulterers at Kingston,
that "there are Capitol geese at Claremont;" which classical
saying of that erudite body has been garbled into the more<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_261" id="Page_261">[261]</a></span>
vulgar observation, that "there are capital geese at Prince
Leopold's;" inferring thereby that part of his Royal Highness's
capital consists of geese!</p>

<p>It is needless to tell you, that the branch of my family
which has settled itself in Norfolk is in the most flourishing
state, and that at Holkham, at this present moment, there is
an old Goose held in high estimation amongst the Whigs. At
Woburn Abbey, another set of my connexions are in high
force, and admirably calculated for cutting up and roasting;
while in the North, the Grey Geese are reckoned invaluable
as a cross breed, the head of that coop being the identical bird
celebrated in the Fable of the Fox and Goose, to which the
Tories have subjoined a very salutary if not pleasant moral.
To the notice of these most honourable birds I may add one
of the younger scions of our stock, the Goslings&mdash;who, as
everybody knows, are a most excellent and respectable firm
in the City of London.</p>

<p>These things disturb me. I have contributed to the funds
of my Master, I am about to lay down my life for his advantage,
and, I repeat, he has never seen me. There are thousands
of geese, I am ready to grant, labouring under the
same disadvantage, and thousands of human beings too, but
to them the disappointment is not of the same nature as to
us: none but geese would contribute to support an absentee
as we do; and yet, supporting him, none but a goose would
care about ever seeing him again.</p>

<p>I must cease&mdash;the poulterer's cart and my end approach.
I have heard that the only modification of my sentence which
I ventured to request&mdash;the change of strangling into decapitation&mdash;is
refused me; His Royal Highness's ministers here
declaring that I cannot be sent off the premises without a
bill. It matters little, Mr. Bull, but I must say, it is not what
I expected. Publish my letter, that my Prince may see how
he is beloved and respected, and by whom;&mdash;he has been at
Rome, but never thought of me or mine; perhaps he never
heard of the story which connects us with that once mighty<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_262" id="Page_262">[262]</a></span>
city. Adieu!&mdash;One of my sisters has already suffered: would
I were a swan, I would sing my own elegy&mdash;they come nearer&mdash;they
have seized my pens&mdash;I can only give&mdash;what we occasionally
have here&mdash;a great quack, and subscribe myself,</p>

<p class="right"><span class="padr2">Your affectionate Gander,</span><br />
<span class="smcap">Billy</span>.</p>

<p>P.S.&mdash;No <em>anser</em> will reach me; but in making any further
inquiries about me, be cautious, as there is a much greater
Goose than myself of my name, living at Bagshot, which,
being in this neighbourhood, might cause some confusion.</p>


<hr class="r15" />
<h3>THE HUM-FUM GAMBOOGEE SOCIETY.<a name="FNanchor_48" id="FNanchor_48"></a><a href="#Footnote_48" class="fnanchor">[48]</a></h3>

<p>The first general meeting of this excellent society took
place on Thursday, at the residence of one of its most powerful
supporters; and, considering the skeleton state of the
metropolis, was satisfactorily attended. We have received
an account of the proceedings, under a promise not to mention
the names of the committee; and the word "confidential"
written diagonally in one corner of our correspondent's letter,
prevents our giving the report as fully and satisfactorily as
we could wish.</p>

<p>The great Gamboogee himself, however, was present, and
explained the nature and intention of the society very
succinctly. It may perhaps be necessary to quote for our
readers this account of their general views, as detailed by his
Lordship.</p>

<p>In the first place, it appears to the excessively correct
persons who compose this grave body, that a Christian should
never be merry&mdash;that it is the bounden duty of all well-disposed
persons to groan and sigh, and make themselves as
uncomfortable as possible during their stay upon earth; and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_263" id="Page_263">[263]</a></span>
in order to render themselves apparently subservient to the
regulations which they propose to lay down for others, the
members have their seats provided on the hardest possible
benches, the president being compelled to sit in very thin silk
breeches, upon a horse-hair bottomed stool, without either
arms or back, <em>i.e.</em>, while they are in public!</p>

<p>Every member is bound, on similar occasions, to wear
large worsted stockings, with the tightest possible shoes, stiff
stocks, and hats considerably too small for their heads. Thus
accoutred, it is their intention to effect, under the authority
they very frequently have on their tongues, a total reformation
in society.</p>

<p>They intend to begin with Brookes's and Boodle's, which
are to be consigned forthwith to the superintendence of
four respectable Dowagers; and the direction of Almack's
is to be vested in the hands of six able ministers, to be
selected by the great Gamboogee himself for that purpose,
next May, previously to the commencement of the ensuing
winter season.</p>

<p>In order to prevent the shameful impositions practised
upon the credulity of minors of fashion and fortune, by
unprincipled women of no property, the Hum-Fum Gamboogees
have opened establishments for the reception of young
gentlemen of worldly propensities, which are to be placed
under the surveillance of most active and pious men.</p>

<p>Similar receptacles for young ladies, whose flagrant desires
lead them into the abominable vices of dancing or singing,
will be prepared, where, in rooms hung with black, and from
which the much too comfortable glare of day will be excluded,
they will be taught to see, in their proper colours, the enormity
of those crimes of which they have been guilty, and
which their sinful mothers, grandmothers, and great grandmothers,
have been rash and vile enough to commit in a
similar way.</p>

<p>It appearing to the Hum-Fum Gamboogees that the sun
is by far too great a blessing for such wretched creatures as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_264" id="Page_264">[264]</a></span>
we are, they recommend a careful seclusion during the day,
and suggest that wet or windy nights are the most suitable
occasions for taking exercise.</p>

<p>A total abstinence from wine is earnestly desired to be
observed by the young gentlemen of London, whose interests
the Hum-Fums have very near their hearts; and they mention
weak black tea as a substitute, or a proportion of that
excellent succadaneum for Hyson, chopped hay, which was
seriously recommended to the attention of the world, a short
time since, through the columns of the <cite>Morning Post</cite>.</p>

<p>Several well-dressed and respectable elderly gentlemen,
with umbrellas, will attend in Hyde Park every day, until
the abomination of frequenting such places be utterly
abolished, to escort young men to pious ordinaries, where it
is recommended they should dine, in order to prevent those
unnatural sins, flirting, dangling, and making the amiable.</p>

<p>A vast many devout minor agents of the society will be
employed to divest the pockets of persons of snuff-boxes, it
never having been required by nature to feed one's nose.</p>

<p>It is strongly recommended that every one should abstain
from frequenting play-houses, and in order to effect this great
object, or at all events to render the performances sufficiently
disagreeable to be quite correct, it is suggested that the
company of performers, who acted at the Haymarket Theatre
last season, be the only persons licensed to exhibit in the
metropolis.</p>

<p>The Hum-Fums will visit the houses of their neighbours,
after the fashion of that most excellent brother corporation,
the Bible Society, and will make it their business to enquire
into the state of every man's domestic affairs; in order, if
possible, to rescue from degradation the servants of London,
whose subordination (although, by the active endeavours of
similar unions, they are getting gradually independent of
their masters and mistresses,) is derogatory to the dignity of
the human character.</p>

<p>The Hum-Fums will distribute amongst the domestics<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_265" id="Page_265">[265]</a></span>
such works as may tend to elevate their minds, open their
intellects, make them dissatisfied with debasement, and
enable them, by the blessing of Providence, to rise superior to
that oppression by which the sinful luxuries of society have
humiliated them. Several Hum-Fums of the highest character
for dulness and gravity will attend in the kitchens and
servants'-halls of each parish, to edify their tenants every
evening from eight till twelve.</p>

<p>It will be the study of the Hum-Fums to impress upon
the soldiers of this kingdom the sin and shame of carrying
muskets and bayonets for pay, and of slaughtering their
fellow-creatures for no cause whatever; and by the way in
which they expect to be enabled to make their light shine,
they hope to convince their brethren in arms that officers are
but men, and that obedience from one man to another is by
no means necessary to salvation.</p>

<p>The sailors they intend to leave entirely to the pious
society called the Bethel Union, convinced that nothing the
Hum-Fums can do will more effectually emasculate and
sanctify at the same time the sea service, and purge it of its
worldly power to do mischief, than the blessed exertions of
that inestimable institution.</p>

<p>Riding in carriages, especially on Sundays, they most
energetically denounce; and it is proposed to solicit the
several lessees of the turnpike trusts round London to allow
ministers, selected by a council of Hum-Fums, to be
placed at the different toll-gates, to dissuade the infatuated
people from enjoying the sun and air of heaven on the only
day which they have to themselves, and on which, in obedience
to the Decalogue, they do no manner of work.</p>

<p>Night agents of the society will be regularly posted at the
doors of all public-houses within the bills of mortality, to
check the ingress of sinners to such places; and in order
more effectually to promote the devout intentions of the
society, Messrs. Whitbread (whose very name inspires
respect), Mr. Calvert, and Mr. Buxton have intimated a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_266" id="Page_266">[266]</a></span>
zealous desire to leave off brewing the liquor which the
wretched sinners are so depraved as to swallow in those
receptacles for vice.</p>

<p>No rank of society will be free from the surveillance of
this pious body. At the Opera, a superior class of agents
will be always in attendance to superintend the friendly
intercourse of the best families, and by an assiduous watchfulness
over the manners and conversations of the various
parties, many of those heartrending divisions in society
which shock morality will be doubtless prevented.</p>

<p>The Hum-Fums earnestly recommend frequent physicking
and bleeding, with a view to the moderation of worldly
appetites; and suggest, in the hope of keeping up an incessant
feeling of the wretched state to which we are reduced,
that all persons between the ages of fifteen and sixty should
wear perpetual blisters.</p>

<p>The Hum-Fums earnestly request subscriptions to carry
their spiritual benefits into effect, and they would impress
upon the minds of those who are hastening to perdition in
the same abominable and destructive road, which every one
of their ancestors and relations have taken, that all things are
subservient to the principles which the Hum-Fums teach,
and that without money the Hum-Fums cannot exist.</p>

<p>After the proceedings in which this development of their
views was made, the Hum-Fums nominated thirty-five
treasurers and sixty-eight secretaries at respectable salaries.
Most of the Hum-Fums being decidedly hostile to the establishment
in State as well as Church, this was considered the
only virtuous mode whereby to provide for those persons,
who, though in humbler life had always relied upon the
Hum-Fums for support, and whose laudable exertions in
exciting a proper melancholy, and a substantial discontent,
deserve the highest praise.</p>

<p>The Hum-Fums, after this part of the ceremony, proceeded
to sing psalms and hymns, the productions of the Rev. Mr.
Smith, of Penzance, whose meritorious conduct under his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_267" id="Page_267">[267]</a></span>
call, from the station of boatswain in His Majesty's service,
to the ministry, demanded their warmest admiration.</p>

<p>Miss Rebecca Engleheart presented the society with a small
pasteboard windmill, in the hopper of which were three
shillings and ninepence halfpenny, which she had collected by
the exhibition of her little toy.</p>

<p>The great Hum-Fum Gamboogee was extremely gratified
by this specimen of pious ingenuity, and put the sails of the
model into rapid motion, which excited great gratitude and
applause.</p>

<p>Two Otaheitean watermen and a New Zealand coppersmith
were elected Hum-Fums: they spoke at length of the
benefits which their respective nations had received from the
exertions of the society, and the latter presented to the
society the heads of his elder brother and his sister-in-law,
which he had cut off since his notions of property had been
matured under its benign influence.</p>

<p>At this period of the proceedings an interruption took place
which threatened the unanimity of the society; this, considering
the society, as we do, to be one, of which all the
members ought to hang together, created a very unpleasant
feeling.</p>

<p>One of the members, more lukewarm <ins class="corr" title="Transcriber's Note&mdash;Original text: 'than   e rest'">than the rest</ins>, inquired
by what authority the Hum-Fums were to take upon
themselves the charge of correcting their neighbours, and
setting the world in general to rights; adding a doubt as to
the obedience of a nation like England, famed for its independence,
and envied for the blessings of religious toleration,
to the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">dicta</i> of a committee of Hum-Fums. "For," said the
pious member, "although I speak under correction, and with
all due deference to the great Hum-Fum Gamboogee and my
sanctified brethren, I do not see the right by which we,
being only men like themselves, are, in a country of liberty,
to control our fellow-creatures in their recreations and amusements;
seeing, that if they are to go to perdition for doing
that, which has been ordinarily done in Great Britain for the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_268" id="Page_268">[268]</a></span>
last four or five centuries, we are to conclude that all our
forefathers have forfeited their hopes of happiness hereafter,
because the system of Hum-Fumism did not exist; which
reflection is not only melancholy, but, as I am bound to trust,
not founded in fact. Moreover, sir," added the brother,
addressing himself to the most venerable Gamboogee, "your
Lordship must know, that in Roman Catholic countries the
Sunday is universally a day of gaiety; that dances, and even
plays, are performed on that day; and since, I believe, many
of the great Hum-Fums who now hear me, voted in another
place in favour of the Roman Catholics, they should be
cautious, while they cry for the admission of such levities
with one breath, not to condemn, with another, to eternal
punishment the Protestants, who, although it must be confessed
they contrive, even in these times of distress, to enjoy
themselves on Sundays, confine themselves to a walk or
drive into the country, with their wives and children, and a
harmless regale of their pipes and their pots, their buggies
and their bottles, or their carriages and their claret, as the
case may be&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Harmless!" said the great Hum-Fum, the buckles of his
wig standing on end!</p>

<p>"And I doubt much," continued the former speaker,
"whether the very proceedings we are about to adopt will
not sicken those of moderately pious lives, and&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Sicken, sir!" interrupted the great Hum-Fum&mdash;"look
at the navy, sir! Do you not perceive that the blessed
institution, the Bethel Union, of which Master Phillips and
myself are the main props, has taken the navy under its
care&mdash;that we are to control the pleasures of the sailors&mdash;to
correct their propensities&mdash;dock them of their girls and their
grog&mdash;and allowance them even in pig-tail? If this experiment
succeed&mdash;if the navy submit to this most proper control
and purification, why should not the army and the laity
generally submit to it too? What did Oliver Cromwell do,
sir? Had not he a preaching army?&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_269" id="Page_269">[269]</a></span></p>

<p>Here a considerable noise of coughing took place; for
though the ultra Hum-Fums were too much involved in zeal
to think of analogies, the designing and radical Hums, who
had merely joined the society for political purposes, felt that
the mention of old Noll might throw the more moderate
into a train of thoughts for which they had not as yet been
sufficiently prepared.</p>

<p>The confusion caused the great Gamboogee to cease; when
a servant entered and whispered his Lordship. What the
communication was we were unable to learn, as an adjournment
was immediately moved and carried. The fact is&mdash;dinner
was ready.</p>

<h3>MORAL THEATRICALS.<a name="FNanchor_49" id="FNanchor_49"></a><a href="#Footnote_49" class="fnanchor">[49]</a></h3>

<p>We have once or twice alluded to a scheme (forwarded to
us by the Author) for rendering theatrical entertainments
strictly moral; and, it appears to us, that no season can be
better suited to its development than the present.</p>

<p>The gentleman, to whose exertions in the behalf of virtue
and decency, the public are even now greatly indebted, and
whose plan, if carried into effect, will entitle him to the gratitude
of the nation at large, is the Rev. Mr. Plumptree,
who has published a volume of dramatic pieces illustrative of
his purpose, which blend with deep interest a purity of
thought and propriety of language rarely to be met with in
the theatrical works of the day.</p>

<p>The first of the dramas is called "Royal Beneficence, or
the Emperor Alexander," and is founded on an event which
occurred to his Russian Majesty, on the banks of the Wilna,
where he restored a drowning young man by the means
prescribed by the Humane Society, which means of restoration
are published with the play&mdash;evidently with the best<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_270" id="Page_270">[270]</a></span>
intentions. Mr. Plumptree offered this piece to Covent
Garden and to Drury Lane, but it was by both rejected;
then Mr. Hindes, the manager of the Norwich playhouse,
had the refusal of it; but he, like the London proprietors,
objected to its appearance because a living character was
introduced.</p>

<p>Mr. Plumptree reasons very fairly upon the futility of
this excuse, and prints the detail of the Emperor's indefatigable
exertions, upon which his play is founded, together
with many other interesting documents concerning the valuable
charity to which the piece is dedicated.</p>

<p>The drama is full of interest and good feeling; and although,
in the present state of the stage, there is, perhaps, a
want of bustle, still the affecting incident at the end of the
first act, where the dead body of the hero is dragged out of
the water, and stripped upon the stage, under the immediate
inspection of the Emperor, who says,&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>"Lose no time in fruitless ceremony: this is our duty now; strip
off his clothes; wipe him dry, and rub about his heart, his temples,
wrists, and everywhere,"&mdash;</p></div>

<p class="noindent">appears to us likely to have produced a great sensation in a
British audience.</p>

<p>We must say, that the rejection of such a piece by the
London managers reflects equally upon their taste and
delicacy.</p>

<p>The next drama is called "Winter," and is founded upon
the story of Elizabeth Woodcock, who was buried in the
snow for upwards of a week, and is extremely pretty. "The
Force of Conscience," a tragedy, follows, which ends with
the execution of Mr. Morris, a blacksmith, on the new
drop, during which awful ceremony he is assisted in prayer
by the Rev. Mr. Jones; the spectators make comments,
and the culprit his last dying speech, when the drop, or
rather the curtain, falls, which ends "the strange eventful
history."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_271" id="Page_271">[271]</a></span></p>

<p>The next play is called "Mrs. Jordan and the Methodist,"
and is founded upon a benevolent action (one of many)
performed by that incomparable actress. We have too
much affection for her memory to make a single comment
upon Mr. Plumptree's delicate attempt to commemorate
her good qualities.</p>

<p>The next is a comedy, called "The Salutary Reproof, or
the Butcher!" from which we intend to make a few extracts,
in order to give a fair specimen of Mr. Plumptree's dramatic
talent and virtuous intentions; and we certainly do hope
that one of the London theatres will afford the town an
opportunity of judging for themselves the benefits likely to
arise to their morals by such representations, without any
curtailment of their amusement.</p>

<p>The play opens with a view of a country village; a public-house&mdash;sign
the Salutation, on one side; on the other side,
a baker's house and shop, and next door a butcher's house
and shop; trees and a seat before it.</p>

<p>Enter the Rev. Mr. Shepherd&mdash;goes to the inn, and is
shut out&mdash;he tries the baker, who will not give him a lodging&mdash;whereupon
he proceeds to the butcher's. As he advances,
he hears a hymn sung by the butcher's family, accompanied
on the oboe. He is shortly after received by the butcher,
and the scene changes to the inside of the butcher's house,
where, as it is described, there is "everything remarkably
neat, and even elegant in a plain way."</p>

<p>Enter Mrs. Goodman, George, and Ruth&mdash;then Goodman
and the Rev. Mr. Shepherd.</p>

<p>The following conversation occurs:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p><span class="smcap">Goodman.</span> Mary, here is a gentleman will lodge here to-night.
Muggins is in one of his surly fits, and has denied him. Put clean
sheets on the bed, and you shall sleep with Ruth, and I with&mdash;George!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. G.</span> What will the gentleman be pleased to have? Pray, be
seated, sir&mdash;take this great chair. Shall I do you a mutton chop, sir?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Goodman.</span> Bring the ease-and-comfort, George.</p></div>

<p>In a long note Mr. Plumptree elaborately describes this<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_272" id="Page_272">[272]</a></span>
machine, and benevolently observes, that no house should be
without at least one of them.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Shepherd.</span> I thank you&mdash;if it will not be giving you too much
trouble, I should prefer tea before everything&mdash;nothing refreshes me
after fatigue like tea.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. G.</span> By all means, sir; the fire is not out in the back-house.
Ruth, put on the kettle; it is hot; and get the tea-things.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">George.</span> (<em>Bringing the ease-and-comfort.</em>) Here, father.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Goodman.</span> Will you rest your legs on this, sir? we call it ease and
comfort.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Shepherd.</span> 'Tis ease and comfort, indeed. I know it by the
name of rest-and-be-thankful. I will beg, if you please, when I go to
bed, the patriarchal hospitality of water for my feet, and that warm.</p></div>

<p>This conversation, which is quite refreshing from its
naturalness, continues till it takes a turn in this manner:&mdash;</p>

<p>It will be observed that Goodman is a butcher.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p><span class="smcap">Goodman.</span> It is said that our laws do not allow a butcher to serve
upon a jury in a case of life and death&mdash;supposing, from his business,
that he must have less humanity than others.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Shepherd.</span> But that, I believe, is not the case; and within my
own confined experience I have known several truly respectable and
humane butchers. Our laws themselves are sanguinary; and they do
not make the same exception to the military or naval characters, both
which professions have too much to do with the effusion of blood.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p><span class="smcap">Goodman.</span> What do you think, sir, of the post-boy who cuts and
over-drives his horses?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Shepherd.</span> What do I think of the gentleman who sits behind
him, and permits it&mdash;nay, encourages him, and pays him extra for distressing
them, merely to bring him a few minutes sooner to the end of
his stage?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Goodman.</span> Sir, I had rather be what I am.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Shepherd.</span> And so had I&mdash;it is a consolation to me often, in my
journeys on foot, that no beast suffers for my accommodation.</p></div>

<p>The vein of morality which runs through the dialogue is
exquisitely touching, and in the hands of Terry or Macready
we think Goodman might be made highly effective&mdash;Young
would be excellent in the "Rev." Mr. Shepherd, and in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_273" id="Page_273">[273]</a></span>
latter part of the act, where Goodman discovers in the
clergyman a friend who "put up at the Wheat Sheaf, at
Blessbury, twenty-five years before," would make a decided
hit&mdash;when pushing away his ease and comfort, the Reverend
Gentleman returns thanks for having made the butcher what
he finds him.</p>

<p>The conclusion of the first act is happily imagined, and
highly theatrical:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Shepherd.</span> If you please, I will retire to rest&mdash;I heard your
evening hymn, and interrupted your prayer in the hope of joining in it.
Of whose devotions do you make use?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Goodman.</span> Bishop Wilson's, sir&mdash;but you will be so good as to lead
for us.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Shepherd.</span> If you please&mdash;but in general I know not that you
can do better than make use of the pious bishop.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Goodman.</span> George, bring the book.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Shepherd.</span> I will have it in my hand, if you please, but our own
peculiar circumstances require our own peculiar thanks and petitions.</p>

<p>[<em>George brings the book, and gives it to Mr. S., and whilst they are
looking at him, as if waiting for his kneeling first, the curtain drops.</em>]</p></div>

<p>It is impossible not to feel such a scene deeply&mdash;its dramatic
quality and the powerful effect that such a style of
representation could not fail to have upon a thinking audience.</p>

<p>In the second act Goodman dispatches a leg of mutton to
Lord Orwell's, and puts up a prayer&mdash;Mrs. Goodman inquires
if the gentleman's shoes are cleaned, and mentions that she
must go and look at the rolls in the camp oven: subsequently
to which we are presented with a scene at his Lordship's,
who desires the butcher to sit down, and enters into conversation
about "Fiorin grass," which Goodman says will produce
six ton per acre. His Lordship then recommends a work
called "The Experienced Butcher," published by Darton and
Harvey, Gracechurch Street, price 6s.&mdash;in return for which
Goodman mentions the arrival of Mr. Shepherd, and recommends
him for the curacy of Gladford, the new rector having
refused to countenance him. Whereupon Lord Orwell says
to the butcher (taking his hand), "Mr. Goodman, this, like<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_274" id="Page_274">[274]</a></span>
every part of your conduct, raises you in my esteem; depend
upon my services wherever they can be useful."</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p><span class="smcap">Goodman.</span> Your Lordship is too condescending&mdash;too good&mdash;to <em>me</em> too.</p>

<p class="right">
[<em>Exit, putting his hand to his eyes, to wipe away the tears.</em><br />
</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lord Orwell.</span> No profession, I see, however rude, can prevent the
growth of humanity, where religion affords its kindly influence. Even
conversation with this butcher I perceive to improve my humanity!</p>

<p class="center"><em>Enter</em> <span class="smcap">Sir William Rightly.</span></p>

<p>Good morning to you, Sir William; you rested well, I hope?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sir W.</span> Quite so, I thank you; your Lordship is well this morning,
I hope? You have been sending your butcher away in tears, I see. I
passed him in the hall; he gave me a look that spoke I know not what;
I felt it at my heart.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p><span class="smcap">Lord Orwell.</span> I think you must have heard me mention this butcher
before; he is not only the best butcher for many miles round, but one
of the best men!</p></div>

<p>His Lordship then characterises Goodman thus:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>I have a great regard for him. In addition to all I have said, there
is a civility and gentleness in his manner&mdash;an ease and frankness&mdash;civil
without servility&mdash;ease without familiarity, and gentle, with much
animation!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sir William.</span> It seems, then, that the butcher, if not a gentleman
has much of the gentleman about him.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lord Orwell.</span> Exactly so. But let us join the breakfast party.</p>

<p class="right">
[<em>Exeunt.</em><br />
</p></div>

<p>There is so much genuine nature in all this, that we certainly
should have no hesitation in foretelling the reception it would
meet with on the stage, if acted. The <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">dénoûment</i> may easily
be anticipated; Mr. Shepherd, instead of being continued as
curate, gets the rectory at Gladford; and Lord Orwell and
Sir William Rightly having walked down to the butcher's,
there conclude the play thus:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>[Lord Orwell and Sir William alternately shake hands with Mrs.
Shepherd and Mrs. Goodman; Mr. Shepherd and Goodman then take
each other cordially by the hand, in the centre, while Lord Orwell takes
Goodman's hand and Mrs. Goodman's; Sir William takes Mrs. Shepherd's
and Ruth's; Mrs. Goodman takes Muggins's, and Muggins
George's; Ruth takes Crusty's, and Crusty his wife's. The curtain drops.]</p></div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_275" id="Page_275">[275]</a></span></p>

<p>As we have already said, the great charm of these pieces
is the perfect representation which they give of <em>real life</em>.
The intimate knowledge of human nature, and of society,
which shines throughout all of them; and, above all, that
consummate skill which, while it affords the richest dramatic
treat, conveys the purest moral lesson.</p>

<p>It certainly is not for us to prescribe to Mr. Elliston; but
we do think that if the play, whence we have made the
above extracts, were acted at Drury Lane, the effect produced
would be extraordinary. To Mr. Plumptree we return our
thanks for his volume, which having read with admiration,
we lay down with infinite satisfaction; and if every author
were to pursue <em>his</em> plan and publish the piece, which managers
have refused, it would very soon put an end to all doubts as
to the cabals and intrigues which agitate, divide, and govern
theatrical cabinets.</p>


<hr class="r15" />
<h3>PRIVATE CORRESPONDENCE OF PUBLIC MEN.</h3>

<p>With considerable exertion, and at a great expense of
capital and research, we have been fortunately enabled to
gratify the prevalent taste for diaries and correspondence; a
gentleman of the highest literary character, moving in the
first circles as well of the political as fashionable world, has
been kind enough to furnish us with no less than twenty-four
volumes of MS. letters and memoranda, the production of all
the leading personages of the last and present century.</p>

<p>It is from the unreserved communication of their thoughts
and feelings that the characters of great men are to be justly
appreciated; and with the addition of the notes, explanatory
and critical, of our highly-gifted friend, we think we shall do
the world a service, and our readers a pleasure, by submitting
portions of the great collection entrusted to our care.</p>

<p>It must be observed that the whole of the correspondence<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_276" id="Page_276">[276]</a></span>
of which we are possessed is strictly of a private nature, and
certainly has never appeared in print before. We give a few
specimens:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p class="center">No. I.</p>

<p class="center">"<span class="smcap">From the Right Hon. William Pitt to Mr. Smith.</span></p>

<p>"Mr. Pitt will be glad to see Mr. Smith to-morrow at twelve.</p>

<p class="pad2">"Downing-street, April 4, 1800."</p></div>

<p>I have not been able to ascertain precisely who this Mr.
Smith was, and the envelope, which possibly might have
shewn the address, has been unfortunately lost&mdash;the name of
Smith is by no means an uncommon one; it is possible that
this note might have been written to a relation of Lord
Carrington, who was created a Baron on the 15th of July,
1796. His Lordship married a Miss Bernard, by whom he
has had one son and eleven daughters.&mdash;<span class="smcap">Ed.</span></p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p class="center">No. II.</p>

<p class="center">"<span class="smcap">From David Garrick, Esq., to Dr. Goldsmith.</span></p>

dinner to-day, at three o'clock.</p>

<p class="right">"Yours, D. G."</p></div>

<p>The authenticity of this short letter is unquestionable; for
although the initials of this British Roscius only are affixed
to it, the date, and the known intimacy which existed
between Garrick and Goldsmith, put all doubt at rest as to
the real writer. It is a curious transcript of the times, as it
marks the hour of dining in the year 1775, in what may be
considered the best authority. Garrick retired from the stage
in 1777, and died in 1779; his widow survived him nearly
half a century. The house at Hampton was purchased by a
Mr. Carr, Solicitor, as I believe, to the Excise, one of whose
daughters was married to Dr. Lushington.&mdash;<span class="smcap">Ed.</span></p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p class="center">No. III.</p>

<p class="center">"<span class="smcap">From Mrs. Letitia Barbauld to Miss Higginbotham.</span></p>

<p>"Mrs. Barbauld will thank Miss Higginbotham to let her have the

<p>"Thursday evening."</p></div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_277" id="Page_277">[277]</a></span></p>

<p>This interesting remain is without date, but it bears the
evidence of truth on its face. Mrs. Barbauld, who was
the daughter of Dr. Aikin, was a highly-talented lady; her
"Beggar's Petition" itself is enough to immortalize her.
The desire to have home a new gown on Saturday night, in
order that she might wear it at church the next day, has a
naturalness in it which is quite refreshing&mdash;a feminine anxiety
operating upon a masculine mind.</p>

<p>I have endeavoured by every possible means to ascertain
who the Miss Higginbotham was, to whom the letter is
addressed, but hitherto in vain. By reference to the files of
newspapers kept at the Chapter Coffee House, in St. Paul's
Churchyard, I see that in the year 1870, a Mrs. Hickenbotham
kept a milliner's shop in Hanway-yard, as it was then called.
But I can hardly fancy it the same person, because in the
first place Mrs. Barbauld distinctly calls her Miss, whereas
the person in question was married; and secondly, because
the name of the milliner to whom the newspaper refers,
is spelt Hickenbotham, whereas Mrs. Barbauld makes the
Hick, Hig, and spells her <em>bottom</em>, <em>botham</em>, after the manner
of the landlord of the Windmill Inn, at Salt-hill, near Eton
in Buckinghamshire.</p>

<p class="center">No. IV.</p>

<p class="center">"<span class="smcap">From the Right Hon. Edmund Burke to Mr. Burns.</span></p>

<p>"<span class="smcap">Burns</span>,&mdash;Get something for dinner by four o'clock to-morrow, and
tell Simmons to have a fire lighted in my bed-room early in the day."</p>

<p class="right">"E. B."</p></div>

<p>The Right Hon. Edmund Burke, one of the most distinguished
of our British worthies, was born at Limerick on
New Year's Day, 1730; he was educated by a Quaker, got
into Parliament in 1765, and died at Beaconsfield, July 8,
1797. Burns I imagine to have been a servant of his, but
I have no particular reason for believing it, beyond the
evidence of the letter before us. The direction to get dinner
ready, comes evidently in the way of a command; and the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_278" id="Page_278">[278]</a></span>
unadorned style of address quite justifies my suspicions.
Simmons is unquestionably a domestic servant, and a female.
In the registry of marriages in Beaconsfield church, I find an
entry of a marriage between Thomas Hopkins and Mary
Anne Simmons, spinster; which Mary Anne I take to be
the individual referred to by Burke. The date of that
marriage is June 15, 1792. Now, although this letter is
without date, it is fair to infer from the reference to "making
a fire in his bed-room," that it was written much earlier
in the year than the month of June; so that even if we
were able to fix the date of the letter in the same year,
it is quite within the range of possibility that the marriage
did not take place till several months after the servant was
spoken of, by her maiden name of Simmons. I took occasion
to visit Beaconsfield twice, concerning this little doubt, and
I think it but justice to make my acknowledgments to
Mr. Thomas Fagg, the deputy-sexton of the parish, for his
urbane attention to me, and the readiness with which he
afforded me all the information of which he was possessed.&mdash;<span class="smcap">Ed.</span></p>

<p>This very curious letter is not more valuable on account
of the matter it contains, than as conducing to throw
additional light upon the mystery of Junius&mdash;it would occupy
too much space in a note to enter into a disquisition concerning
the various conflicting opinions upon this subject, but
as far as a comparison of hand-writing with some portions
of the MS. of Junius's Letters, which I had an opportunity
of seeing, and a strong similarity of style in the writing,
go, I have no hesitation in settling the authorship upon Sir
Philip&mdash;there is such vigorous imagination displayed in the
description, in nine words, of the state of the weather and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_279" id="Page_279">[279]</a></span>
the metropolis, and such a masculine resolution evinced in
the declared determination to "fly from all its ills and
inconveniences" the very next day, that one cannot but
pause to admire the firmness which could plan such a
measure, and the taste which could give such a determination
in such language. The cautious concealment of the place to
which the supposed party of pleasure was to go, is another
evidence of the force of habit&mdash;I have reason to believe it to
have been Twickenham, or as Pope spells it, Twitnam, but
I have no particular datum whereon to found this suspicion,
except, indeed, that I think it quite as probable to have been
Twickenham, or Twitnam, as any other of the agreeable
villages round London.&mdash;<span class="smcap">Ed.</span></p>

<p>There can be little doubt that the note referred to by Sir
Joshua was full of those quibbles and quaintnesses for which
Whitefoord was so well known. Whitefoord was a man
of considerable attainments, and was distinguished by the
peculiarity of his dress; a French grey coat with black frogs,
a small cocked hat and an umbrella&mdash;he was the constant
frequenter of auctions, and has the credit of being the
inventor of the now hacknied concit called "Cross readings."
It is certain, that in his note sent with the venison,
he called Sir Joshua his deer friend, hoped it would suit his
pallate, recommended him to take some cuts from it and
transfer them to plates, spoke of the current sauce being
jelly, and perhaps signed himself his Buck friend (for at
that period the words Buck and Maccaroni were the distinctive
appellations of two classes of persons in London). I surmise<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_280" id="Page_280">[280]</a></span>
this, because he was a confirmed punster, a character somewhat
prized in those days. Goldsmith said it was impossible
to keep company with him without being infected with the
itch of punning. He is celebrated in the postscript to
"Retaliation:"&mdash;</p>

found at least equal to many others whose pretensions are
much more formidable, and which, after all, do not exhibit
so faithfully the peculiar characteristics of the private lives
of public men.</p>

<h3>THE COCKNEY'S LETTER.</h3>

<p>The following letter has been transmitted to us, as written
by a Cockney gentleman late in the train of Lord Byron,<a name="FNanchor_50" id="FNanchor_50"></a><a href="#Footnote_50" class="fnanchor">[50]</a> but
now discarded&mdash;we are not sufficiently acquainted with the
style of the writer to vouch for its genuineness, but we give
it as we have received it:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>My dear &mdash;&mdash;, &mdash;I am astonished at what you write me. So then,
notwithstanding all the strong articles in our last Liberal Magazine,
neither Government nor people has made a stir; England is still
a monarchy, England is still a monarchy, and not even a single change
in the ministry has been effected! Jeffrey, (Byron's new friend,)
who is always sanguine, thinks the next Number must do it, but I
begin to despair; and the worry-one's soul-out, as it were, effect of the
disappointment on my health is very visible. I pine, and grow thinner
and paler every day. My appearance, by the way, is very interesting
and Tasso-like, and I think an engraving of me would sell well in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_281" id="Page_281">[281]</a></span>
England, where a "how-does-he-look" sort of inquiry must be in
everybody's mouth just now. But let that pass for the present, I have
matter of still greater moment for you.</p>

<p>The only subject of conversation now in England, and indeed in all
those parts of Europe where tyrants are not as <em>yet</em> allowed to send in
fellows with bayonets to stop people's mouths whenever they mention
my name, must be the coolness between me and Byron, and it is
proper the rights of it should be known, which is better than folks
going about with a he-said-this&mdash;and then-he-said-t'other sort of
report of it. The fact is, that Byron is the aggressor, for he began
first, as the children say, and all about a piece of patrician pride, very
unbecoming among us radicals. Some time ago, seeing him in conversation
with the Earl of&mdash;&mdash;, at the end of the Strada di&mdash;&mdash;, I
hopped down the street, and, just to shew the intimacy which subsisted
between us, slapped him on the back with a "Ha! Byron, my
boy!" He darted at me one of his look-you-through sort of glances,
and turned from me without speaking; and it was not till after
a decided cut of eight or ten days that, wanting something done, he
sent for me. I went; he began by a tread-you to-dirtish, as it were
taking of me to task, said something about the "coarse familiarity of your
radicals;" and then told me that I might stop and dine with him that
day, which I did. You will gather from this that these lords are not
to be depended upon, they are but a half and half sort of radicals&mdash;the
cloven foot of nobility is perpetually peeping out, they won't give
altogether into that hail-fellow-well-metishness, which we expect
from them. Again: at dinner that day, happening to say to him, "I
and you, Byron, who are called the Satanic School:" he cut me short
unceremoniously, and said, "Who the h&mdash;ll ever called <em>you</em> Satanic?&mdash;Cockney,
if you please and reminded me of the fable of the apples
swimming. Now, putting radicalism out of the question, this was
very ungenteel from one great poet to another&mdash;then he is jealous of
me. We have had a disagreement about which of us should have
the most room to write in the Liberal Magazine. He wanted all;
which (though I never contradict him, or he'd have cut me long ago.)
I almost remonstrated against, so he allowed me a corner here and there,
as it were. Thus he flatly attributes our slow sale to my poetry&mdash;then
to my prose&mdash;and in short, he was lately so insulting that I had "ever
such a mind" (as we used to say at school) to tell him the fault was
all his own; for between ourselves he has grown as stupid and as
vulgar as the best of us. But worst of all, I find he has been making
a mere tool of me, and he quizzes me to my very face. Some weeks
ago I told him I had thoughts of writing his life, to which he replied
with a smile, "Do;" but when I added that he ought in return to write
mine, he exclaimed with a sneer "Pooh!" and went away in a turn-on-the-heel<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_282" id="Page_282">[282]</a></span>
sort of fashion. But this is of a piece with his refusing to
call me Tasso and Ariosto in exchange for my calling him Dante in our
next poems.</p>

<p>Doubtless you have heard of the verses I addressed to him; I suppose
there is an I-wish-I-could-get-'em sort of anxiety about them in England,
so I send you a copy:&mdash;</p>

<p class="center small">"LINES TO MY FRIEND BYRON.</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<p class="verseq">"Dear Byron, while you're out walking, I'll just say</p>
<p class="verse">Something about ourselves in my off-hand way,</p>
<p class="verse">Easy and Chaucer-like; in that free rhyme</p>
<p class="verse">They used to warble in the olden time,</p>
<p class="verse">And which you so chucklingly listen to when I</p>
<p class="verse">Pour out a strain of it, as 'twere, chirpingly;</p>
<p class="verse">Full of all sorts of lovely, graceful things,</p>
<p class="verse">Smacking of fancy, pretty imaginings,</p>
<p class="verse">Which I trick out with a Titian-like sort of air,</p>
<p class="verse">And a touch of Michael Angelo here and there;</p>
<p class="verse">For though the graceful's wherein I excel,</p>
<p class="verse">I dash off the sublime, too, pretty well.</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p class="verseq">"Now, let me see&mdash;I have it&mdash;I'll suppose,</p>
<p class="verse">(Though you're there in the garden plucking a rose,)</p>
<p class="verse">That, after travelling many and many a day,</p>
<p class="verse">You are wandering in some country far away,</p>
<p class="verse">When, being tired, you stretch beneath a tree,</p>
<p class="verse">And take from your pocket my Rimini,</p>
<p class="verse">And read it through and through, and think of me;</p>
<p class="verse">And then you take some other work of mine,</p>
<p class="verse">And con it daintily, tasting it line by line,</p>
<p class="verse">Pausing 'tween whiles, as one does drinking port,</p>
<p class="verse">And smack your lips, saying, 'This is your right sort.'</p>
<p class="verse">And when it has grown too dark for you to see,</p>
<p class="verse">You close the book and wish for your dear Leigh:</p>
<p class="verse">Then comes a little bird, fluttering near,</p>
<p class="verse">And perches, fairy like, on the tip of your ear;</p>
<p class="verse">Then up you jump and would hunch it away;</p>
<p class="verse">But, spite of all, the little bird will stay,</p>
<p class="verse">And then&mdash;&mdash;(But what I'm writing all this while</p>
<p class="verse">Is a fancy in my wild Ariosto style)&mdash;</p>
<p class="verse">And thus this little bird turns into me,</p>
<p class="verse">And you rush forward to me in ecstasy,</p>
<p class="verse">And grasp my hand, as it were, clutchingly,</p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_283" id="Page_283">[283]</a></span>
<p class="verse">And call me your 'dear Leigh;' while I, e'en bolder,</p>
<p class="verse">Cry, 'Ah, my dear Byron!' clapping you on the shoulder,</p>
<p class="verse">E'en just as I might be supposed to do,</p>
<p class="verse">If this were not a Poet's dream, but true."</p>
</div></div></div>

<p>Now, I expected this would have procured me a sonnet at least in
return, but he did not even deign ever once to notice it, spite of all my
attempts to draw him out about it. You, who know what an excessively
sensitive creature I am, will easily conceive the heart-in-one's-mouthishness
of my sensations, when I found out his real opinion of me. It
happened one day that he left me alone in his study. He had no sooner
turned his back than I began to fumble among his books and papers.
What I most earnestly sought was the copy I gave him of my "Story
of Rimini," thinking to find it full of notes in his own hand-writing. It
was not even half cut open! A proof he had not half read it. Against
"my dear Byron," in the dedication (for you know I dedicated it to
him) I found written "Familiar Cockney," and in the last leaf cut&mdash;that
is as far as I presume he had read,&mdash;was written the following
critique:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<p class="verseq">"O! Crimini, Crimini!</p>
<p class="verse">What a mimini, pimini,</p>
<p class="verse">Story of Rimini!"</p>
</div></div></div>

<p>This you will say was sufficiently cut-one-to-the-heartish, but this
was little compared with what follows. Among other things, I found
the MS. of the Twelfth Canto of Don Juan, which will shortly appear.
By the way, it is rather unfair in him, to say no less of it, to throw
"Cockney" in my teeth at every turn, considering that I have now quite
given up talking of Highgate and Primrose Hill, ever since I have seen
the Apennines&mdash;and to a friend, too! But it is my friend Byron's
way; he calls and uncalls all his friends round, once in every four or five
years, or so. But to my extract from his next canto:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<p class="verse16">"Filthy scum!</p>
<p class="verse">These Hunts, Hones, Despards, Thistlewoods, and Ings!</p>

<p class="verse">But that we turn'd them to our dirty uses?</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p class="verse4">My tool I've lately placed upon the shelf,</p>
<p class="verse">So patronize my Cockney now who chooses;</p>
<p class="verse4">I've ta'en to do my dirty work myself.</p>
<p class="verse">I find, too, that in fashion my abuse is,</p>

<p>There, my dear friend&mdash;and this is from one radical to another!&mdash;the
root of all this is, that I did once hint to him that I thought myself
a better poet than he; more antique and to-the-heartish, giving my
verses an Italian twang, and so forth. As to his allusion to my thinking
myself fit to be prime minister, I merely threw out an idea that way,
once when we were re-modelling. No. V. of our Liberal Magazine shortly.
Let tyrants tremble!&mdash;Yours ever.</p></div>

<h3>BYRONIANA.<a name="FNanchor_53" id="FNanchor_53"></a><a href="#Footnote_53" class="fnanchor">[53]</a></h3>

<p>By favour of a friend just arrived from the Mediterranean
we have received exclusively some most interesting papers
relative to Lord Byron; they consist of anecdotes, which have
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_285" id="Page_285">[285]</a></span>never been known, and some original letters, which have never
been out of the hands of the individual by whom we are
favoured. Some of his Lordship's more recent conversations
are detailed, which will be found highly amusing and characteristic.
We submit a few extracts, which we trust will prove
acceptable to our readers.</p>

<p>"Lord Byron," says our correspondent, "had several
peculiarities; he reduced himself from corpulency to the
contrary extreme, by eating raisins, and occasionally sipping
brandy. He used frequently to observe that brandy was a
very ardent spirit, and remarked that to persons anxious to
conceal the strength of their potations, hollands was better
adapted, inasmuch as being of a similar colour with the water,
the quantity mixed with that liquid was less easily detectable
by the eye.</p>

<p>"Lord Byron was perhaps more sensible of approaching
changes in the weather than any other man living. One day,
on a voyage to Athens to eat beef-steaks, a dark cloud appeared
to windward of the vessel; his Lordship regarded it
steadily for some time, until at length, feeling a few drops of
rain fall, he called to Fletcher to bring his cloak, so certain
he was of an approaching shower. Byron always slept with
his eyes closed, and if by any accident he lay on his back,
snored remarkably loud; he was very particular in his toothpicks,
and generally used those of a peculiar kind of wood,
in preference to quills.</p>

<p>"In writing letters of an ordinary cast, his style was plain,
clear, and perspicuous; a specimen follows, it is addressed to
a friend:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p class="right padr4">Tuesday.</p>

<p>'<span class="smcap">Dear</span> &mdash;&mdash;,</p>

<p class="right"><span class="padr2">Will you dine with me to-morrow?&mdash;</span><br />
<span class="padr6">Yours truly,</span><br />
<span class="padr2 smcap">Noel Byron</span>.'
</p></div>

<p class="noindent">The next is to a person who had been recommended to his
notice, and whom he felt it necessary to invite. We suppress<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_286" id="Page_286">[286]</a></span>
the name of the party, lest Mr. Hobhouse should get an
injunction.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>'Lord Byron's compliments to Mr. &mdash;&mdash;, requests the pleasure of his
company at dinner on Wednesday next.'</p></div>

<p>"These sort of notes he would secure indiscriminately
with wafers or wax, as the case might be.</p>

<p>"One day conversing with him upon the state of Greece,
and the great struggle in which we were all engaged, he observed
to me, 'that a very small proportion of the population
of London had been in the Archipelago.' When I assented,
he said&mdash;with a sigh which went to my heart, and in a tone
which I shall never forget&mdash;'It would be very strange if they
had.'</p>

<p>"He had a strong antipathy to pork when underdone or
stale, and nothing could induce him to partake of fish which
had been caught more than ten days&mdash;indeed, he had a singular
dislike even to the smell of it; some of his observations
upon this subject will be given in a new quarto work
about to be published by a very eminent bookseller.</p>

<p>"He spoke of Harrow with strong feelings of affection, and
of the lovely neighbours of Dr. Bowen&mdash;(who they were he
carefully concealed from us)&mdash;they were tenants of the same
house with the late Duke of Dorset, who was Byron's fag.
To a lady of the name of Enoch, who lived in a cottage at
Roxeth, he had addressed some of his early productions, but
had destroyed them. He used to ask me why Mr. Procter
called himself Cornwall? 'he might as well call himself
Cumberland,' said Byron, with his accustomed acumen.</p>

<p>"It has been remarked that Byron spoke of his own child
with affection. Strange and unnatural as this may appear, it
is literally the fact. It seems, however, to have excited so
much surprise, that it is absolutely necessary to be particular
in impressing the truth upon the British nation, who are so
deeply interested in everything which relates to the immortal
poet departed.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_287" id="Page_287">[287]</a></span></p>

<p>"The poem which he wrote upon the close of his thirty-sixth
year has been published and republished so often, that we do
not think it worth printing here. But the observation made by
its great author to our correspondent is curious and striking:&mdash;</p>

<p>"'I have written these verses on closing my thirty-sixth
year,' said Byron. 'I was always superstitious&mdash;thirty-six
is an ominous number&mdash;four times nine are thirty-six;
three times twelve are thirty-six; the figures thirty-six are
three and six&mdash;six and three make nine, so do five and four'&mdash;he
paused and said&mdash;'Mrs. Williams, the old lady who told
my fortune, is right. The chances are, I shall not live six
and thirty years more.' The fact has proved that he was not
ungifted with the power of divination.</p>

<p>"Byron died, as I have just said, in his thirty-sixth year.
What makes this coincidence the more curious is, that if he
had lived till January, 1844, he would have completed his
fifty-sixth, a circumstance which, curious as it is, we believe
has not been noticed by any of his biographers.</p>

<p>"I once proposed to him to take a companion on a tour he
was about to make; he answered me snappishly&mdash;'No;
Hobhouse once went with me on a tour&mdash;I had enough
of him. No more travelling companions for me.'</p>

<p>"He used frequently to compare himself to Buonaparte&mdash;so
did we, to please him. Buonaparte had a head, so had
Byron, so has Mr. Hayne of Burderop Park, Wilts, so has a
pin; he was tickled with the comparison, and we lived with
him, and swallowed toads at discretion.</p>

<p>"Moore, the author of the 'Fudge Family,' was a great
favourite of Byron's; he had not discovered that it was Moore
who persuaded Hunt&mdash;the man who made Rimini&mdash;that he
was a mighty clever fellow, and that if he set up a periodical
work, he (Moore) would contribute to it: Moore constantly
abused Hunt to Byron at the same time&mdash;called him a stupid
Cockney, and swore that Byron was ruining himself by associating
with him. This was kind and liberal, and justifies
what Douglas Kinnaird and everybody else indeed say of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_288" id="Page_288">[288]</a></span>
Moore just now&mdash;Byron would not have liked Moore the
better for this&mdash;poor Hunt had a wife and children, and was
in needy circumstances, and Byron did them great service&mdash;and
what harm could Hunt do Byron, or anybody else?</p>

<p>"The Greeks think Byron will come to life again after a
while, and one poet in the Chronicle, probably Moore, talks
of having seen his <em>manes</em> in George-street, Westminster, and
of the possibility of his yet wandering about Greece, in a white
dressing-gown, singing 'Liberty Hall;' but I, who know
Byron well, and all his expectations, doubt the fact. I was
surprised to find, considering how right and fashionable it is
to praise my departed friend, that his wife declined seeing his
body, and all his family declined attending his funeral.</p>

<p>"He told me one night that &mdash;&mdash; told &mdash;&mdash; that if &mdash;&mdash; would
only &mdash;&mdash; him &mdash;&mdash;. She would &mdash;&mdash; without any
compunction; for her &mdash;&mdash;, who though an excellent man,
was no &mdash;&mdash;, and that she never &mdash;&mdash;, and this she told
&mdash;&mdash; and &mdash;&mdash; as well as Lady &mdash;&mdash; herself. Byron told
me this in confidence, and I may be blamed for repeating it;
but &mdash;&mdash; can corroborate it if he happens not to be gone to
&mdash;&mdash;."</p>


<hr class="r15" />
<h3>LORD WENABLES.<a name="FNanchor_54" id="FNanchor_54"></a><a href="#Footnote_54" class="fnanchor">[54]</a></h3>

<p>To those who are in the habit of recurring with a feeling of
devotion to the golden gone-by times of our forefathers,
and who "track back" upon antiquity to hunt out subjects
for admiration, it must be in some degree consolatory to
discover, that even in these degenerate days there still exist
amongst us men capable of recording the noble deeds of the
"mighty living;" and that one of the most important occurrences<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_289" id="Page_289">[289]</a></span>
of modern date has found an historian worthy of the
subject which it has been made his duty to transmit to posterity.</p>

<p>To such of our readers as are generally conversant with
the history, political or statistical, of the City of London,
it may perhaps be needless to observe, that it affords, by
virtue of its charter and constitution, power and authority,
might and majesty, for one year at a time, to one illustrious
individual (made, indeed, illustrious by his office), and that
this illustrious individual is pre-eminently distinguished
above all others of God's creatures (within his special
jurisdiction) by the title of Lord Mayor. Having been a
Liveryman, he proceeds to Sheriff and Alderman, and in
time, being an Alderman, he becomes Mayor, and being
Mayor of London, becomes a Lord!&mdash;that he is not a Peer,
arises only from the difficulty of finding any to compare with
him.</p>

<p>Thus, then, it being conceded that there is, and always
will be, a Lord Mayor of London, so long as London stands&mdash;for
the constitution of Cornhill and the majesty of the
Mansion House remain unshaken by the storms of treason or
the efforts of rebellion, and shine in all their native excellence
with equal purity and brightness, whether under the gentle
sway of an amiable Mary, the gloomy troubles of a martyred
Charles, the plain dominion of a protecting Oliver, or the
glorious sway of a liberating William&mdash;it being then, we say,
conceded that the Lord Mayor, officially, never dies, we
seek to show the imperative necessity which presses upon
every Lord Mayor while in office, personally so to distinguish
himself from the long line of his predecessors and those who
are to follow him, by some striking deed, either bodily or
mental, political or financial, literary or scientific, so that
when he shall have returned from the pinnacle of earthly
splendour at the corner of Walbrook into the softer retirement
of his patrimonial shop in Pudding-lane or Fish-street-hill,
children yet unborn may learn to lisp the name of their
great ancestor mingled with their prayers, never forgetting<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_290" id="Page_290">[290]</a></span>
to singularise him especially from all the other Figginses,
Wigginses, Bumpuses, and Snodgrasses of their respective
houses, by prefixing in their minds to the patronymic, the
deed, or work, or act, or book, as it may be, by which that
particular branch of their family has so flourished into virid
immortality.</p>

<p>By observing this system, an association is formed in the
mind of men and deeds highly refreshing, at once useful and
agreeable. Who ever hears of Walworth without thinking of
Wat Tyler?&mdash;who ever reads of Whittington without having
a Cat in his eye?&mdash;who speaks of Wood without thinking
of Whittington?&mdash;who of Waithman without recollecting
Knightsbridge foot-path? Thus it is that these illustrious
men are distinguished, not only from all other Lord Mayors,
but from all other Whittingtons, Walworths, Woods, and
Waithmans, in the world.</p>

<p>With such examples before him, was it unnatural, or not
to be expected, that the late Lord Mayor, Venables, should
be contented to sink back into the shades of Queenhithe
from the Civic throne without leaving something behind him
which might entitle him to fill a niche in the Temple of
Fame? We think not; and we have no hesitation in saying
that his Lordship's well-directed ambition, blending as it has
done the eminently-useful with the strikingly-agreeable, has
produced results which will hand him down to future ages
with as much grace, certainty, and propriety as his Lordship
ever exhibited in his late great life-time in handing down an
Alderman's lady to dinner.</p>

<p>When we say, "late life-time," we mean official life&mdash;Venables
the man, is alive and merry&mdash;but, alas! Venables
the mayor, is dead.</p>

<p>It now becomes our duty to explain what it is that has so
decidedly stamped the greatness of Lord Wenables&mdash;so he
was called by the majority of his subjects&mdash;and in doing so,
we have to divide (although not in equal parts) the fame and
glory of the enterprise between his Lordship and his Lord<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_291" id="Page_291">[291]</a></span>ship's
Chaplain, who, upon this special occasion, and at his
Lordship's special desire, was the historian of his Lordship's
exploits.</p>

<p>It seems, that in the course of last summer, the Lord
Wenables having over-eaten himself, brought upon himself a
fever and rash, and during his confinement to the house the
disorder took an ambitious turn, and his Lordship's organ
of locomotiveness having been considerably enlarged and
inflamed by his Lordship's having accidentally bumped his
noble head against the corner of the bedstead, his Lordship
was seized with a desire to glorify and immortalise himself by
foreign travel the moment he got better of his green-fat fever&mdash;and
having sent for his Chaplain to consult upon some sort
of expedition which might answer his purpose, his Lordship
and the Divine deliberated accordingly.</p>

<p>At one time he suggested going down the shaft of Brunel's
tunnel at Rotherhithe, but the work was not far enough
advanced to render it even commonly hazardous&mdash;that was
abandoned. Going up in a balloon was suggested, but there
was no utility blended with the risk. The dreadful dangers
of Chelsea reach had already been encountered, and a colony
established by his Lordship on the east end of Stephenson's
Island, beyond Teddington&mdash;something even more daring
must be tried; and, as it happened that a first cousin of my
Lady Wenables had been reading to his Lordship, who was
not able to read himself (from illness, not from want of
learning), "Travels undertaken in order to discover the
Source of the Nile," his Lordship at once resolved to signalise
himself by undertaking a journey to discover, if possible, the
"Source of the Thames." His Lordship was greatly excited
to the undertaking upon being told that Mungo Park had
been carried into Africa by a similar desire&mdash;and he observed
with wonderful readiness, that if it were possible to remove a
whole Park into Africa, there could be no insurmountable obstacle
to transporting Lady Wenables to the source of the
Thames.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_292" id="Page_292">[292]</a></span></p>

<p>When Lord Wenables was first put upon the project,
he was rather of opinion that the source of the Thames was
at its mouth&mdash;"a part which," as his Lordship observed,
"is in man the source of all pleasure;" and he suggested
going by land to Gravesend, to look out for the desired
object. But the Chaplain informed his Lordship that rivers
began at the other end&mdash;upon which his Lordship, not having
gone so far into the study of geography as to ascertain the
exact course of the river beyond Stephenson's Island, hinted
his intention of going with Lady Wenables by land as far
as Dunstable, and then proceeding in the search.</p>

<p>The Chaplain, it seems, although not quite sure enough of
his experience to give Lord Wenables a downright negative
to his suggestion, deemed it necessary forthwith to consult
a map of Europe, in which the relative courses of the River
Thames and the Dunstable turnpike-road are laid down
in different degrees of latitude, and having ascertained that
Dunstable was an inland town, proceeded to examine his
charts until he discovered Oxford to be a more likely point
to start from with any reasonable hopes of success; this he
mentioned to Lord Wenables, and when his Lordship arose
convalescent from his calipash fever, he mentioned his design
to the Court of Aldermen on Midsummer Day, and the last
week of July was ultimately and unanimously fixed upon
for the expedition.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>"Instructions," says the author of the history of the expedition,
"were, accordingly, agreed to be given to the Town Clerk, to secure
such accommodation at an inn in Oxford, Reading, and Windsor, as
might be adequate for the civic party; and to make every other necessary
arrangement."</p></div>

<p>And here, before we go any further, it may be necessary
to state, that the work of which we are about to speak has
actually been written by command of Lord Wenables, by
his ci-devant Lordship's ci-devant Chaplain, and published
by Messieurs Longman, Rees, Orme, Brown, and Green,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_293" id="Page_293">[293]</a></span>
embellished with two beautiful engravings; all we should
add is, that the author is perfectly serious in his details,
and that our extracts are made from his work, correctly
<span lang="la" xml:lang="la">verbatim et literatim</span>.</p>

<p>Scarce had the Lord Wenables and his Council decided
upon going to Oxford, when the Corporation of that City
sent them a letter inviting them to dinner on the 26th.
This unexpected and welcome letter puzzled the Lord and
his Council, inasmuch as they had fixed only to stay one
day at Oxford&mdash;that day the 26th, and on that day to entertain
(as no doubt they would) the heads of houses at dinner.</p>

<p>That the Lord Wenables and his Aldermen could have
arranged the matter satisfactorily to all parties by eating
two dinners in one day is evident, but not at the same time,
and upon this dilemma the reverend author makes this
communication:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>"From this difficulty," says he, "they were happily released by the
question, 'Could not your Lordship go a day sooner to Oxford?' It
was immediately seen that this slight alteration of the plan first intended
would obviate every difficulty: it would allow them the opportunity of
showing their respect to the Mayor and Magistrates of Oxford by dining
with them on the Tuesday; and would also give them the honour of
having the University and City to dinner on the Wednesday."</p></div>

<p>The quickness of perception in the Lord Wenables and
his Aldermen, which gave them the advantage of "immediately
seeing" that by going to Oxford on the 25th, they
could dine there on the 26th, and by staying till the 28th
they might also dine there on the 27th, if they liked, is well
worthy of praise; and the liberality of inviting the University
and City to dine at the Star Inn, cannot fail to impress upon
the reader the magnificence of Lord Wenables' mind. Suffice
it to say, the Mayor of Oxford accepted the Mayor of
London's invitation, and that the Mayor of London adopted
the Mayor of Oxford's proposition.</p>

<p>The reverend author then says:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>"Every preliminary arrangement being completed, and ample accommodation
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_294" id="Page_294">[294]</a></span>
having been secured at the Star Inn, Oxford, for his Lordship
and suite, to the number of about thirty persons, the civic party began
to lay their plans for the journey!</p>

<p>"It had been previously understood that while his Lordship and
friends should return together, in the City state barge, they should yet
go to Oxford in such a way, and at such a time, as best comported with
their own convenience. Mr. Alderman Atkins, accompanied by two of
his daughters, Miss Atkins and Miss Sarah Jane, left his seat, Halstead
Place, in Kent, on Monday, the 24th of July, and set out from London
for Oxford in the cool of the following morning. On the same day, Mr.
Alderman and Mrs. Lucas, with their daughters, Miss Charlotte and
Miss Catharine, left their house, at Lee, in Kent, and went by land as
far as Boulter's Lock, near Maidenhead, where they embarked on board
the Navigation shallop, and proceeded by water to Reading; thus selecting
some of the finest views on the river."</p></div>

<p>Lord Wenables himself was, however, not so rash; for
having satisfied himself of the actual existence of Oxford by
receiving a letter from one of the natives, he resolved to
proceed thither by land. See we then from his reverend
chaplain's history the mode of his Lordship's setting forth:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>"On the morning of the 25th, the Lord Mayor, accompanied by the
Lady Mayoress, and attended by the Chaplain, left the Mansion House,
soon after eight o'clock.</p>

<p>"The private state-carriage, drawn by four beautiful bays, had driven
to the door at half-past seven. The coachman's countenance was reserved
and thoughtful, indicating full consciousness of the test by which
his equestrian skill would this day be tried, in having the undivided
charge of four high-spirited and stately horses&mdash;a circumstance somewhat
unusual; for, in the Lord Mayor's carriage, a postillion usually
guides the first pair of horses. These fine animals were in admirable
condition for the journey. Having been allowed a previous day of unbroken
rest, they were quite impatient of delay, and chafed and champed
exceedingly on the bits, by which their impetuosity was restrained.</p>

<p>"The murmur of expectation, which had lasted for more than half
an hour, amongst the crowd who had gathered around the carriage, was
at length hushed by the opening of the hall-door. The Lord Mayor had
been filling up this interval with instructions to the <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">femme de menage</i>!
and other household officers, who were to be left in residence, to attend,
with their wonted fidelity and diligence, to their respective departments
of service during his absence, and now appeared at the door. His<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_295" id="Page_295">[295]</a></span>
Lordship was accompanied by the Lady Mayoress, and followed by the
Chaplain.</p>

<p>"As soon as the female attendant of the Lady Mayoress had taken
her seat, dressed with becoming neatness, at the side of the well-looking
coachman, the carriage drove away; not, however, with that violent
and extreme rapidity which rather astounds than gratifies the beholders;
but at that steady and majestic pace, which is always an indication of
<span class="fs70">REAL GREATNESS</span>!</p>

<p>"Passing along Cheapside and Fleet Street&mdash;those arteries, as Dr.
Johnson somewhere styles them, through which pours the full tide of
London population&mdash;and then along the Strand and Piccadilly, the
carriage took the Henley-road to Oxford.</p>

<p>"The weather was delightful; the sun, as though it had been
refreshed by the copious and seasonable showers that had fallen very
recently, seemed to rise more bright and clear than usual, and streamed
in full glory all around. The dust of almost a whole summer had been
laid by the rain; the roads were, of consequence, in excellent order, and
the whole face of creation gleamed with joy!"</p></div>

<p class="noindent">In fact, creation was so delighted with the appearance of
Lord Wenables, that "Nature wore an universal grin."</p>

<p>The reverend gentleman then describes the blowing up of
a powder-mill as they reached Hounslow, which at first
startled Lord Wenables, who imagined fondly that he had
accidentally set fire to the great river whose source he was
seeking; but Lady Wenables concurred with the reverend
writer in assuring his Lordship that he might make himself
perfectly easy upon that particular point.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>"At Cranford-bridge," says the reverend author, "which is about
thirteen miles from Hyde Park Corner, the Lord Mayor staid only long
enough to change horses. For, his Lordship intending to travel post
from Cranford-bridge to Oxford, his own fine horses were, after a proper
interval of rest, to return to town under the coachman's care.</p>

<p>"These noble animals, however, seemed scarcely to need the rest
which their master's kindness now allotted them. For though they
had drawn a somewhat heavy carriage a distance of nearly seventeen
miles, they yet appeared as full of life as ever; arching their stately
necks, and dashing in all directions the white foam from their mouths,
as if they were displeased that they were to go no farther!</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_296" id="Page_296">[296]</a></span></p>

<p>"Just as the carriage was about to drive away, Mr. Alderman Magnay,
accompanied by his lady and daughter, arrived in a post-chaise!
After an interchange of salutations, the Lady Mayoress&mdash;observing that
they must be somewhat crowded in the chaise&mdash;invited Miss Magnay to
take the fourth seat, which had as yet been vacant in the carriage. As
the day was beginning to be warm, this courteous offer of her Ladyship
was readily accepted."</p></div>

<p>Here we have, in one short page, a striking instance of the
"true instinct" of Lord Wenables' fine horses, who were
quite displeased that they were not allowed to drag him any
farther&mdash;a delightful picture of a worthy Alderman and his
family&mdash;three in a chay&mdash;a splendid specimen of Lady
Wenables' sagacity and urbanity, and a fair estimate of the
value of the latter upon the mind of the young invitée, who
accepted her Ladyship's offer of a seat in the state coach
because the day was beginning to get warm!</p>

<p>In safety, however, did Lord Wenables get to Oxford, of
which, the reverend author says&mdash;"There is something peculiarly
imposing in the entrance, particularly in the eastern
entrance, to this city." Now this, which is ably twisted into
the beginning of a flourishing description of towers and
colleges, evidently refers to the toll at the Bridge-gate, and
which Lord Wenables, who paid the turnpikes himself and
kept the halfpence in the coach pockets, declared to be one
of the greatest impositions at the entrance of a city that
he had ever met with.</p>

<p>We are unable to give our readers the account of the
highly honourable reception which Lord Wenables met with
at Oxford, or the description of the dinner of which he
partook&mdash;but we must, let what may happen, extract the
whole account of the dinner given by his Lordship to the
Oxfordians&mdash;a dinner which took place after a somewhat
protracted lecture on comparative anatomy, which, if it
failed in the delivery of establishing a likeness between a
"bat" and a "whale," most certainly bears evidence, in its
transmission to paper, of the great similitude between a
Lord Mayor's Chaplain and a donkey.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_297" id="Page_297">[297]</a></span></p>

<p>It will be needless for us to make an observation upon
what follows:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>"The hour of six had scarcely arrived, when the company, invited by
the Lord Mayor to dine with him at the Star, began to assemble. The
City watermen, in their new scarlet state liveries, were stationed in the
entrance hall; and a band of music was in attendance to play on the
arrival of the visitors."</p></div>

<p>The reverend author, by blending the band and the
watermen (who are also firemen), leaves it somewhat doubtful
to which corps the duty of playing on the arrival of the
visitors was confided. He proceeds:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>"In a large drawing-room, on the first floor, fronting the street, on a
sofa at the upper end, sat the Lady Mayoress, accompanied by Mr.
Charles Venables, and surrounded by the other ladies of the party.
The City Marshal of London, Mr. Cope, dressed in full uniform, and
carrying his staff of office in his hand, took his station at the door, and
announced the names of the guests as they severally arrived. Near the
entrance of the room also stood Mr. Beddome, in a richly-wrought
black silk gown, carrying the sword downwards. The Lord Mayor, who
was in full dress, and attended by the Chaplain in clerical robes, wore
on this occasion the brilliant collar of S.S. (<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">quære</i> A.SS.) The Worshipful
the Mayor, and the other Magistrates of Oxford; Richard Cox, Esq.,
Thomas Fox Bricknell, Esq., Aldermen; William Folker, Esq., Thomas
Robinson, Esq., Richard Ferdinand Cox, Esq., Assistants; Mr. Deodatus
Eaton, and Mr. Crews Dudley, Bailiffs; together with Mr. Percival
Walsh, the City Solicitor, attended by the Town Clerk, in his robe of
office, which resembled in some degree the undress black silk gown worn
by Gentlemen Commoners of the University&mdash;were all severally introduced,
and received by the Lord Mayor with a warmth and cordiality
adequate to that which they had so kindly manifested on the preceding
day.</p>

<p>"The Vice-Chancellor of Oxford, the Rev. Dr. Richard Jenkyns,
Master of Baliol, preceded, as usual, by one of the Yeomen Bedels,
carrying a large mace, and the Rev. Dr. Thomas Edward Bridges,
President of Corpus Christi College, the Rev. Dr. George William Hall,
Master of Pembroke; the Rev. Dr. Nicholas Philip Shuttleworth,
Warden of New College; the Rev. Dr. John Dean, Principal of St.
Mary's Hall, and Lord Almoner's Prælector in Arabic; together with the
two Proctors, the Rev. George Cumming Rashleigh, M.A., and the Rev.
Wadham Harbin, M.A.; the Rev. Mr. Woodgate, to whom allusion has<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_298" id="Page_298">[298]</a></span>
before been made, and other Members of the University, all of whom
were dressed in full academicals, were severally introduced to the Lady
Mayoress. To this distinguished list of visitors must be added the
names of John Fane, Esq., one of the Members of Parliament for the
county of Oxford; and James Haughton Langston, Esq., and John
Ingram Lockhart, Esq., Members for the City of Oxford.</p>

<p>"When dinner was announced, the party, amounting to nearly
sixty persons, each gentleman taking charge of a fair partner, descended
to a long room on the ground floor.</p>

<p>"Every attention had been given by the proprietor of the Star to
render the dinner as excellent as the occasion required, and to fit up
the dining-room with as much taste as its extent would admit of;
and no means had been left untried to keep the apartment as cool
as possible. Wreaths of flowers were hung thickly round it, and the
windows, which opened on a garden, were overspread with branches
of trees, to exclude, as much as possible, the warm beams of a
western summer sun. The band of musicians now removed their
station from the entrance hall to the garden under the windows, where
they played, at proper intervals, with excellent effect, the whole evening.
The Lord Mayor and Lady Mayoress took their seats at the
head of the table, the Vice-Chancellor of the University sitting on the
right hand of his Lordship, and the Chief Magistrate of Oxford on
the left of her Ladyship. The heads of the Houses then took their
seats, according to the priority of their admission to the degree of
Doctor, alternating with the ladies and daughters of Aldermen Atkins,
Magnay, Heygate, and Lucas. The Aldermen of London and of
Oxford then filled the remainder of the table.</p>

<p>"Amidst much elegance and beauty, the Lady Mayoress attracted
particular observation. Her Ladyship was arrayed in the most
splendid manner, wore a towering plume of ostrich feathers, and blazed
with jewels!</p>

<p>"When the Chaplain, by craving a blessing on the feast, had set the
guests at liberty to address themselves to the dainties before them, and
the room was illuminated throughout by a profusion of delicate wax
candles, which cast a light as of broad day over the apartment, it
would not have been easy for any eye, however accustomed to look on
splendour, not to have been delighted, in no common manner, with the
elegance of the classic and civic scene now exhibited in the dining-parlour
of the first inn in Oxford.</p>

<p>"The accompaniments, indeed, fell short of that splendour which
they would have had in the Egyptian Hall of the Mansion House in
London, but still the general effect was peculiarly striking; and when
the rank of the company is considered, may with truth be called
brilliant!</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_299" id="Page_299">[299]</a></span></p>

<p>"The conversation naturally assumed that tone best qualified for the
discovery of those talents and learning, of which the evening had drawn
together so select and bright a constellation.</p>

<p>"After dinner, as soon as the health of the King, the welfare of the
Church, the prosperity of the University and City, and other toasts of
loyalty, literature, and religion, had been honoured, the Lord Mayor
proposed the health of the Vice-Chancellor of Oxford. This was followed
by toasts to the health of the other Heads of Houses, the Professors,
and Proctors; the Worshipful the Mayor and other Magistrates
of Oxford, and the Right Hon. the Lord Mayor of London; each toast
giving rise to such acknowledgments as the individuals, to whom they
referred, considered appropriate and adequate. The health of the Lady
Mayoress, and the other ladies of the company, was proposed by one of
the Heads of the Houses; the toast was hailed with warm demonstrations
of respect, and the honour was acknowledged with considerable
point and taste by Mr. Lockhart, the Member, at her Ladyship's
request.</p>

<p>"The Ladies, who, to the great gratification of the Company, had sat
longer than is usual at most tables, at length obeyed the signal of the
Lady Mayoress, and retired to the drawing room,</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<p class="verse12">'With grace,</p>
<p class="verse">Which won who saw, to wish their stay.'</p>
</div></div></div>

<p class="noindent">"The conversation was, however, in no degree changed in their absence.
The Lady Mayoress and her fair friends had taken their share in it with
much good sense and delicacy; and their departure, so far from being succeeded
by that obstreperous and vulgar merriment, or anything like
that gross profligacy of conversation, which indicates rejoicing at being
emancipated from the restraint of female presence, only gave occasion to
the Magistrates of Oxford to express their wish, that, in the invitations
to their Corporation dinners, arrangements could be made that would
include the ladies."</p></div>

<p>After such a dinner and such an evening, it may easily be
imagined that Lord Wenables and his Court slept like tops&mdash;not
but that his Lordship had "requested his friends not to
devote too many hours to repose." In obedience to a wish,
which when breathed by a Lord Mayor becomes a command,
everybody was up and busy "while the morning was
early:" the yeoman of his Lordship's household, half
covered with an awning, was occupied with the cook, who<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_300" id="Page_300">[300]</a></span>
was busied on this lovely day in making a fire to boil the
tea-kettle, in a grate in the bow of the boat.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>"About seven o'clock," says the reverend historian, "signals of the
approach of his Lordship's party were descried and heard. The populace,
thickly stationed on the road through which the carriages were to pass,
caught up the acclamation; and announced to all who thronged the
margin of the river, that&mdash;&mdash;the Lord Mayor was coming! His
Lordship and the Lady Mayoress alighted from the carriage at the
bridge, and walked through the respectful crowd, which divided to give
them passage; and were at once conveyed to the state barge&mdash;&mdash;in the
Water Bailiff's boat!"</p></div>

<p>The shouts of delight which rent the air were music to the
ears of greatness&mdash;it was quite a genial morning, and one of
those days "when we seem to draw in delight with the very
air we breathe, and to feel happy we can scarcely tell why."
So writes the reverend author, with more taste than judgment;
for a man, placed as he was in the society of Lord
Wenables and his Court, not to know why he felt happy,
shows, we fear, a want of perception equally lamentable with
the want of tact displayed in confessing it.</p>

<p>The reverend author laments that the eagerness of the
party to do honour to the delicacies of the Lord Mayor's
breakfast-table, prevented their seeing the beauties of
Nuneham.</p>

<p>At ten o'clock they made Abingdon&mdash;and at Clifton the
water shoaled suddenly from eighteen inches to fourteen and
a half, so that his Lordship's yacht, which drew nearly two
feet, could be drawn no farther, and they remained hard and
fast till a fresh supply of the element could be procured.</p>

<p>The following passage is in the author's happiest style:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>"The crowds of people&mdash;men, women, and children&mdash;who had accompanied
the barge from Oxford, were continually succeeded by fresh
reinforcements from every town and village that is skirted by the river.
Distant shouts of acclamation perpetually re-echoed from field to field, as
the various rustic parties, with their fresh and blooming faces, were seen
hurrying forth from their cottages and gardens; climbing trees, struggling
through copses, and traversing thickets, to make their shortest way to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_301" id="Page_301">[301]</a></span>
the water-side. Handfuls of halfpence were scattered to the children as
they kept pace in running along the banks with the City Barge; and Mr.
Alderman Atkins, who assisted the Lord Mayor in the distribution,
seemed to enter with more than common pleasure into the enjoyment
of the little children. It was gratifying to see the absence of selfish
feeling manifested by some of the elder boys, who, forgetful of themselves,
collected for the younger girls."</p></div>

<p>It will be remembered that the voyage now under detail
was undertaken in the dreadful year of panic&mdash;but we confess
we had no idea of the desperate state of affairs in the country
which could induce so severe a run on the banks for a few
halfpence, such as is here described. It may not be uninteresting
to trace the source of the Lord Wenables's munificence.
The halfpence in question were those which we mentioned his
Lordship to have taken in change at the turnpike-gates during
his Lordship's over-land journey to Oxford, and were now
distributed with that liberality and grace for which his Lordship
and Mr. Alderman Atkins will never cease to be remembered.
The reverend writer, indeed, says:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>"There is, unquestionably, something genuine and affectionate in the
cheerfulness of the common people, when it springs from the bounty
and familiarity of those above them: the warm glow of gratitude
spreads over their mirth; and a kind word or look, or a little pleasantry,
frankly said or done&mdash;and which calls in no degree for any sacrifice of
personal dignity&mdash;always gladdens the heart of a dependant a thousand
times more than oil and wine. It is wonderful, too, how much life and
joy even one intelligent and good-humoured member of a pleasure-party
will diffuse around him. The fountain of indwelling light, which
animates his own bosom, overflows to others; and every thing around
quickly freshens into smiles."</p></div>

<p>It is, we fear, too evident that this passage comes direct
from the reverend writer's heart: it seems clear to the
meanest capacity, that he speaks from experience&mdash;perhaps
of himself&mdash;when he expresses the delight which <em>even one</em>
intelligent person can convey to a party. It is quite clear,
that in the party now assembled there either was no intelli<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_302" id="Page_302">[302]</a></span>gent
person, or only one&mdash;at least, the observation of the
author leaves little room to doubt the disagreeable fact.</p>

<p>At page 80, the following account of the natives of Caversham
and the neighbouring districts is given, which is at once
romantic and picturesque:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>"Among the equestrians, two are deserving that their looks and
equipments should be alluded to in more than general terms. The
animals they bestrode were a couple of broken-down ponies, <ins class="corr" title="Transcriber's Note&mdash;Original text: 'guant'">gaunt</ins> and
rusty, who had possibly once seen better days. The men themselves
were not unsuitable figures for such a pair of steeds. They rode with
short stirrups, that brought their knees almost under cover of the
shaggy mane that overspread the ewe necks of the poor creatures; and
carried their short thick sticks perpendicularly in their hands. Such was
the appearance of these country wights as they shambled along the road
that gave them so good a view of the City State Barge. And so
mightily pleased was the Lord Mayor with their uncouth and ludicrous
appearance, that he hailed one of them, and asked him to be the bearer
of a message to Reading, touching his Lordship's carriage. The fellow
seemed to feel as he never felt before! An honour was about to be
conferred upon him alone&mdash;to be the <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">avant-courrier</i> of the Lord Mayor
of London!&mdash;above and beyond all other riders, drivers, and walkers
of whatever quality and degree, who had thronged to the view of the
civic party. And no sooner had his Lordship flung him a piece of
money, and told him to 'make haste to the Bear Inn, Reading, and order
the Lord Mayor's carriage to meet the barge at Caversham Bridge,' than
the fellow instantly belaboured the starveling ribs of the poor animal
that carried him, with kicks and cudgel; who, in a moment, dashed
briskly forward, snuffling and snorting across the fields. In the eagerness
of his flight, the doughty messenger had much ado to maintain his
seat: he sometimes slipped on one side of the saddle, and sometimes on
the other; while the skirts of his unbuttoned coat fluttered out far behind
him. He executed his commission, however, with fidelity equalled only
by the dispatch which he had used; for when the barge arrived at
Caversham Bridge, the carriage was waiting the Lord Mayor's arrival.
Other carriages were also in attendance. It was now nearly nine
o'clock; and as the evening shadows were beginning to shroud the surrounding
scenery, the Lady Mayoress, and the other ladies of the party,
except the Misses Atkins, fearful of too long exposure to the night air,
landed at the bridge, amidst the firing of guns and other demonstrations
of respectful salutation, and proceeded in their carriages to Reading."</p></div>

<p>That a Lord Mayor should devote much time to Reading,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_303" id="Page_303">[303]</a></span>
Mr. Rogers would declare highly improbable&mdash;but his Lordship
and party partook of a sumptuous supper and went to
bed. That we cannot devote much more space to Lord
Wenables is equally mortifying&mdash;suffice it to say, that on the
following day, after a hearty breakfast, an eleven o'clock
snack, and a one o'clock luncheon, Lord Wenables and his
court partook of a cold collation at Cliefden, at which were
present Mrs. Fromow and her son, Broom Witts, Esq.; the
Mayors of Maidenhead, Windsor, and Reading, the brothers
and sisters of Lord Wenables, and sixty or seventy other
persons.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>"The gardens and grounds were thronged with spectators, either
strolling about or seated on the grass; and on the opposite banks,
several tents were erected for general convenience; around which the
children shouted and threw up their hats!"</p></div>

<p>What particular occurrences excited the mirth and activity
of the children round this particular spot, the reverend gentleman
omits to mention; the following, however, must not
be overlooked:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>"The increasing pressure of the surrounding people now rendered
the adoption of some plan necessary by which their curiosity could be
better gratified. Arrangements were accordingly made to admit the
female part of the spectators, in small successive parties, to walk
round the tables as the company were seated at dinner; and it was
curious to see how many eager eyes were strained, and fingers pointed,
to distinguish the individuals of the party. But it was something
more than a mere idle feeling of curiosity that prompted this anxiety
in the honest peasantry to see the Lord Mayor of London."</p></div>

<p>It seems, in fact, that Lord Wenables was born in those
parts, so that his anxiety about the source of the Thames
was in fact instinctive and intuitive, and as natural as it was
laudable.</p>

<p>The next thirty or forty pages of the work consist of a
character of his late Majesty, an account of Mr. Wenables's
paper-mill, and a description of the royal Castle at Windsor,
copied, we presume, from the Guide to that building, which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_304" id="Page_304">[304]</a></span>
has been long since published for the benefit of Lions, at the
small charge of sixpence.</p>

<p>The details of breaking a bottle over the stone at Staines
we cannot give, although the anxiety of Lord Wenables to
discover the London water-mark appears to have been professionally
natural. At Richmond the barge remained&mdash;like
the great Lord's stock in trade&mdash;<em>stationary</em>, and his Lordship's
fine foaming horses having been delighted once more with the
sight of his Lordship, dashed from Richmond to the Mansion
House with a celerity which, although somewhat inconsistent
with "true dignity," brought the illustrious personage, his
wife, his chaplain, and his sword-bearer, to the end of the
Poultry in "no time;" having safely achieved an adventure
which will hand down to posterity the great names of Wenables
and Fromow, and the unrivalled powers of an historian,
who (though modesty may induce him to keep himself snug)
will live in his works till time shall be no more.</p>

<h3>LORD WENABLES AGAIN.<a name="FNanchor_55" id="FNanchor_55"></a><a href="#Footnote_55" class="fnanchor">[55]</a></h3>

<p>The editor of these memoirs, anxious to do justice to Mr.
Firkins's feelings, and to Mr. Gurney's accuracy in recording
them, considers that he cannot do more for the establishment
of the sincerity of one party, and the correctness of the
other, than may be done by submitting a few extracts from
an authentic work, published many years subsequent to the
period to which Mr. Gurney refers, giving an account of the
journey of Lord Mayor Wenables to Oxford, written and published
at the desire of his lordship, and his companions in
that enterprise, by his lordship's chaplain. As the romance
of real life is said to be infinitely more romantic than that of
fiction, so the details of dignity, splendour, and magnificence,
ably and carefully written by the rev. gentleman, by which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_305" id="Page_305">[305]</a></span>
the expedition of Alderman Wenables was distinguished, very
much transcend the description given by our respected
acquaintance Firkins, to my much-regretted friend Gurney.
The extracts must be brief&mdash;but I am convinced they will be
highly satisfactory.</p>

<p>The first quotation I shall make from the reverend author's
book, is the description of the departure of the Lord Mayor
from the Mansion House. It is headed "Tuesday," and
begins at page 11:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>"On the morning of the 25th (July), the lord mayor accompanied
by the lady mayoress, and attended by the chaplain, left the Mansion
House soon after eight o'clock.</p>

<p>"The <em>private state</em> carriage" (I ought to observe, the italics are
mine) "had driven to the door at half-past seven" (which, by the
way, as an act of volition upon the part of the private state coach,
was extremely attentive). "The coachman's countenance was reserved
and thoughtful; indicating full consciousness of the test by which his
equestrian skill would this day be tried, in having the undivided
charge of four high spirited and stately horses, a circumstance somewhat
unusual: for in the lord mayor's carriage, a postilion usually
guides the first pair of horses,"&mdash;<em>i.e.</em> the postilion in the carriage guides
the leaders, which are the farthest removed from it.</p>

<p>"These fine animals," says the reverend author, "were in admirable
condition for the journey&mdash;having been allowed a previous day of
unbroken rest; they were quite impatient of delay, and chafed and
champed exceedingly on the bits, by which their impetuosity was
restrained.</p>

<p>"The murmur of expectation, which had lasted for more than half
an hour amongst the crowd who had gathered around the carriage,
was at length hushed, by&mdash;the opening of the hall door. The lord
mayor had been filling up this interval" (the door?) "with instructions
to the <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">femme de ménage</i> and other household officers who were to be
left in residence, to attend with their wonted fidelity and diligence to
their respective departments of service during his absence, and now
appeared at the door. His lordship was accompanied by the lady
mayoress, and followed by the chaplain.</p>

<p>"As soon as the female attendant of the lady mayoress had taken
her seat, dressed with becoming neatness, at the side of the well-looking
coachman, the carriage drove away; not, however, with that violent
and extreme rapidity which rather astounds than gratifies the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_306" id="Page_306">[306]</a></span>
beholders; but at that steady and majestic pace which is always an
indication of real greatness."&mdash;P. 12.</p></div>

<p>The reverend gentleman describes this majestic progress
through London to Cranford Bridge; a powder-mill at
Hounslow is blown up on the way; but at Cranford Bridge,
"just thirteen miles from London," the lord mayor staid
only long enough to change horses&mdash;"for his lordship intending
to travel post from Cranford Bridge to Oxford, his own
fine horses were, after a proper interval of rest, to return to
town under the coachman's care."</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>"These noble animals, however, seemed scarcely to need the rest
which their master's"&mdash;job&mdash;"kindness now allotted them, for though
they had drawn a somewhat heavy carriage a distance of nearly
seventeen miles, yet they appeared as full of life as ever; arching their
stately necks, and dashing in all directions the white foam from
their mouths, as if they were displeased that they were to go no
farther."&mdash;P. 16.</p>

<p>"Just as the carriage was about to drive away" (more volition),
"Mr. Alderman Magnay, accompanied by his lady and daughter,
arrived in a post-chaise. After an interchange of salutations, the
lady mayoress, observing that they must be somewhat crowded in
the chaise, invited Miss Magnay to take the fourth seat, which had yet
been vacant in the carriage; as the day was beginning to be warm,
this courteous offer of her ladyship was readily accepted."</p></div>

<p>Here is a perfect justification of Firkins's regrets at his
fall&mdash;the unhappy trio, jammed in the <em>po chay</em>, had been the
year before in precisely the same elevated position which
their illustrious friends then occupied; and if the courteous
lady mayoress the year before that, had been screwed up
with her husband and daughter in a <em>po chay</em> also, then Mrs.
Magnay would have been the courteous lady mayoress,
to have relieved the Wenableses. I must, however, think
that the reverend gentleman's reason for Miss Magnay's
ready acceptance of the courteous offer does her an injustice.
By his account, she readily got out of the family jam, not
because she duly appreciated the grace and favour of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_307" id="Page_307">[307]</a></span>
lady mayoress, but because "the day was beginning to
be warm."</p>

<p>The journey to Oxford was all safely completed, and after
seventy-six pages of matter, equally illustrative of Firkins's
feelings, we come, at p. 77, to this description of the rapture
and delight of the people of Oxfordshire, under the exciting
circumstances of the lord mayor's return down the river
towards London:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>"The crowds of people&mdash;men, women, and children&mdash;who had
accompanied the barge from Oxford, were continually succeeded by
fresh reinforcements from every town and village that is skirted by
the river. Distant shouts and acclamations perpetually re-echoed
from field to field, as the various rustic parties, with their fresh and
blooming faces, were seen hurrying forth from their cottages and
gardens, climbing trees, struggling through copses, and traversing
thickets to make their shortest way to the water side. Handfuls of
halfpence were scattered to the children as they kept pace with the
city barge, and Mr. Alderman Atkins, who assisted the lord mayor
in the distribution, seemed to enter with more than common pleasure
into the enjoyment of the little children. It was gratifying to see
the absence of selfish feeling manifested by some of the elder boys,
who, forgetful of themselves, collected for the younger girls."&mdash;Pp.
77, 78.</p></div>

<p>The last bit for which I have room, is of the more convincing
and powerfully descriptive cast, than anything I
have yet advanced in favour of my poor friend Gurney's
estimation of Firkins's dismay at his fall. The scene is near
Caversham, where crowds of "spectators, some on foot,
some on horseback, and some in equipages of every kind,"
were collected to see the barges pass.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>"Among the equestrians," says the author, "two are deserving
that their looks and equipments should be alluded to in more than
general terms. The animals they bestrode were a couple of broken-down
ponies, gaunt and rusty, who had possibly once seen better
days. The men themselves were not unsuitable figures to such a
pair of steeds. They rode with short stirrups, that brought their
knees almost under cover of the shaggy manes that overspread the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_308" id="Page_308">[308]</a></span>
ewe necks of the poor creatures; and carried their short thick sticks
perpendicular in their hands."</p></div>

<p>This sounds like an account in one of the innumerable
books of travels in the interior of Africa, rather than a
description of a couple of natives of Berkshire, within five-and-thirty
miles of Hyde Park Corner; however, "so
mightily pleased was the lord mayor with their uncouth and
ludicrous appearance, that he hailed one of them, and asked
him to be the bearer of a message to Reading, touching his
lordship's carriage. The fellow seemed to feel as he never
felt before. An honour was about to be conferred upon him
alone, to be the <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">avant courier</i> of&mdash;'the Lord Mayor of
London,' above and beyond all the other riders, drivers, and
walkers, of whatever quality and degree, who had thronged
in view of the civic party; and no sooner had his lordship
flung him a piece of money, and told him to 'make haste to
the Bear Inn at Reading, and order the lord mayor's carriage
to meet the barge at Caversham Bridge,' than the fellow
instantly belaboured the starveling ribs of the poor animal
that carried him with kicks and cudgel, who in a moment
dashed briskly forward, snuffling and snorting, across the
fields. In the eagerness of his flight, the doughty messenger
had much ado to keep his seat; he sometimes slipped on one
side of the saddle, and sometimes on the other, while the
skirts of his unbuttoned coat fluttered far out behind him."&mdash;Pp.
81, 82.</p>

<p>All this evidence from the pen of a worthy divine, will, I
am sure, convince the most sceptical reader of the fidelity
with which my late friend repeated the regrets and lamentations
of our friends in Budge Row, after their involuntary
abdication. Every page of the account of that memorable
journey and voyage teems with gem-like illustrations of a
similar character; and I regret that my duty, as editor of
the Gurney Papers, does not permit me to draw more largely
on its stores.</p>

<h3>MODERN IMPROVEMENTS.</h3>

<p class="center smcap">To John Bull.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sir</span>,&mdash;I am not one of those who snarl at modern improvements,
but I admit my incapacity to find out the improvements,
at which other people snarl&mdash;I consider gas and steam
to be two of the most odious and abominable nuisances ever
tolerated in a Christian country: I only ask the best-natured
critic&mdash;the most impartial judge in Christendom&mdash;whether
anything can smell more abominably than the vapour which
thousands of pounds are hourly spent to produce? If ruining
oil-men, and beggaring wax-chandlers, is sport, well and
good&mdash;in Heaven's name stew down the wholesome coals
and make smoke, and set fire to it: but don't call that an
improvement.</p>

<p>I love the sight of a lamp-lighter&mdash;a "jolly Dick" in a
greasy jacket flaring his link along the pavement, rubbing
against one's sleeve, or besprinkling one's shirt with oil&mdash;I
seldom see one of them now; the race is superseded by a
parcel of dandies, with dark lanthorns in their hands, prowling
about like so many Guy Fawkes's: up they go, and without
taking off the green lamp-tops and putting them on their
heads, as the jolly Dicks did, they open a door, turn a cock,
introduce their lanthorn&mdash;piff, paff, poff,&mdash;out comes the
light, and down goes the ladder&mdash;this is innovation, not
improvement.</p>

<p>Then steam&mdash;what's the improvement of steam? There
was an interest in a short sea voyage when I was young&mdash;contrary
winds&mdash;tides against one&mdash;nature had fair play&mdash;but
now Mr. This-thing or Mr. T'other-thing makes a great copper
pot, and fills it with water&mdash;more coals; poking and stoking,
and shovelling and raking&mdash;Nature is thrown overboard;
and the pacquet-boat, uninfluenced either by her smiles or
frowns, ploughs up the waves, and marches along, like a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_310" id="Page_310">[310]</a></span>
couple of wandering water-mills. There is no interest in
this, sir&mdash;any fool can make a copper pot&mdash;any fool can fill
a copper pot with water&mdash;any fool can make a fire, and poke
it, and make water boil&mdash;there's no pleasure in this life
when events are thus provided for, and that, which had all
the interest of doubt and difficulty, is reduced to a certainty.</p>

<p>The same in land carriage&mdash;formerly, a stage coach journey
was an affair&mdash;a thing to be thought about&mdash;a man took
leave of his relations, left his home, in the expectation of
never seeing his wife again; then there was an interest, a
pleasure in the speculation, and a hope, and a fear, and a
doubt, and something to keep the faculties awake. Now, sir,
if you want to go sixty or seventy miles, you have hardly settled
yourself comfortably in your corner, before you are at
your journey's end. Why, sir, before these jigamaree things
were invented, I have lived two-and-twenty days on board a
Leith smack, for three pounds three shillings, and enjoyed
a pleasant five days' excursion on the road to Plymouth;
whereas at present I am whirled from Edinburgh to London
in forty hours, and taken from Piccadilly to Dock&mdash;Devonport
I mean&mdash;in about half that time. Now this, to my
mind, is no improvement.</p>

<p>Then, sir, look at London&mdash;look what the improvers have
done&mdash;pulled up the pavements, the pride of the land, and
turned the streets into roads. This Muckadamizing is no
improvement. Puddles for purbecks is a bad exchange&mdash;the
granite grinding is no wonder&mdash;the rattle and clatter of
London is at an end. One might as well be at Slough or
Southall, or any of the environs, as be in the heart of the
town. They have taken away Swallow-street&mdash;scene of my
youthful pleasures; and, to crown all, they are pulling St.
James's Park to pieces, planting trees, and twisting the water.
Why did not they leave the canal straight, as the Serpentine
is? Are we to come back to the days of Duck Island, with
a Whig governor for it? Why are the horses and cows
disturbed to make way for the people? I love to see horses<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_311" id="Page_311">[311]</a></span>
and cows happy. I like to see the barracks and hospitals. I
don't want to look at great big rows of high houses, filled
with people who can afford to live in them, while I cannot.
This is no improvement.</p>

<p>Then for manners and customs: in my time we dined
early and sat late, and the jolliest part of our lives was that
which we passed with our legs under the mahogany. Now,
we see no mahogany&mdash;we dine at supper-time and the cloth
stops and the wine never moves; away go our women&mdash;no
healths&mdash;no toasts&mdash;no gentleman to cover a lady&mdash;no good
wishes&mdash;nothing convivial&mdash;one anonymous half glass, sipped
silently, and the coffee is ready. Out we go, turned adrift at
eleven, with nothing on earth to do for the rest of the evening,
unless one goes to a Club, where, if a man asks for anything
stronger than soda water, he is looked at as a monster.
Hock and Seltzer water, perhaps, if it's hot weather&mdash;wimbly
wambly stuff, enough to make a cat sick, and after that,
home. Why, in my time, sir, I should have laughed at a fellow
who flinched before his fourth bottle, or who submitted to the
degrading circumstance of finding his way to bed of his own
proper discretion. But those days are past&mdash;one thing I <em>do</em>
thank the stars for&mdash;we are getting back to the tobacco&mdash;not
indeed the beautiful lily pipe, tipped rosily with sealing wax,
and pure as the driven snow, but a happy succedaneum&mdash;a
cigar. I do love a cigar, sir; it reminds me of the olden
time, and I like the smell of my clothes in the morning,
which I congratulate myself none of our modern improvements,
as they are called, can ever eradicate.</p>

<p>Perhaps you have been lately in the Regent's Park&mdash;I will
tell you what is doing there&mdash;a Mr. Somebody&mdash;I forget his
name, but it is somehow connected in my mind upon Von
Feinagle's principle with a Christmas pie&mdash;Horner, by Jove,
that's it&mdash;he has sunk twenty thousand pounds, and raised a
splendid building&mdash;a temple&mdash;a pantheon&mdash;a feature in the
town&mdash;and what do you think for?&mdash;to exhibit a panorama
of London from the top of St. Paul's, just within a couple of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_312" id="Page_312">[312]</a></span>
miles of St. Paul's itself&mdash;but then we are to be saved all the
trouble&mdash;to be screwed up to the eminence without labour:
to my mind, the whole point of a fine prospect is the trouble
of getting to it&mdash;far-fetched and dear-bought are the great
attractions, and all the interest is destroyed if things are
made too easy of attainment. I don't like this plan.</p>

<p>The same struggle against nature seems to be going on
everywhere&mdash;see the theatres&mdash;even at that band-box the
Adelphi&mdash;there was a difficulty in getting in, and a difficulty
in getting a seat when one did get in; now it is all made easy
and comfortable, and for what? To see a schooner so like
what any one can see any day in the river, that it is no sight
at all; like Lawrence's pictures&mdash;I hate that President&mdash;his
things are like life, the likenesses are identity, and so like
nature that there is no merit in the painting&mdash;I like a little
doubt&mdash;I love to show my quickness by guessing a portrait&mdash;the
interest is destroyed if there is no question about the
thing&mdash;the same with shooting&mdash;I used to hit my bird and
miss my bird, and walk and walk over the furrows, and climb
over the hedges and ditches, and bang away with a gun of
my poor father's, which, when it did go off, was not over-certain
in its performance&mdash;I liked the pursuit&mdash;now, with
your Mantons and percussions, your Nocks without flints,
and all that sort of thing&mdash;wet or dry, off they go&mdash;slap
bang, down tumbles the bird for each barrel, and the thing is
over&mdash;I never shoot now&mdash;a thing reduced to a certainty
loses all interest.</p>

<p>Before Palmer's time I used to keep up a constant correspondence
with a numerous circle of friends and acquaintance;
there was no certainty about the delivery of one's letters&mdash;mail
carts were robbed&mdash;post-boys were murdered&mdash;bags
found in a pond all soaked to rags; then, there was an
interest in it; now, a letter never miscarries; all like clockwork.
I hate that Freeling&mdash;his activity and vigilance have
destroyed the interest. I haven't written to a friend for the
last fifteen years, nor should I write to you now, only<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_313" id="Page_313">[313]</a></span>
that I send my letter by a servant lad, who is a member of
an Intellectual Institution, and so stupid, that I think it is at
least ten to one that you ever receive it.&mdash;Perhaps you will
just acknowledge it, if it comes to hand&mdash;the expectation
will, at least, serve to keep up the interest.</p>

<p class="center">Yours truly,</p>
<p class="right smcap">Stephen Brown.</p>
<p class="small">Baker Street, Oct. 17, 1828.</p>


<hr class="r15" />
<p class="center smcap">To John Bull.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sir</span>,&mdash;I perceived the other day in your columns a letter
from a gentleman of the name of Brown, who, in the most
cynical, sneering manner, thought fit, unjustly as I think, to
run down all our modern improvements&mdash;I know you are
impartial, and love to give upright adversaries fair play in
your paper; I differ with Mr. Brown, and perhaps you will
give me the opportunity of showing how and why.</p>

<p>In the first place, the ridicule, which not only he, but, I
am sorry to say, yourself and many others, think fit to cast
upon the advancement of learning, and which you have nick-named
the march of intellect, is entirely misplaced&mdash;you look
at things politically, because politicians of a peculiar class
have adopted the institution of societies, seminaries, and
universities&mdash;this is wrong&mdash;considering the matter thus, and
associating men and manners, you teach us to believe the
march of intellect the "rogues' march," to which all the well-disposed
middling classes are to go to destruction; but you
should consider the matter differently; you should recollect
that almost all the political supporters of these Mechanics'
Institutes and London Universities have imbibed their political
principles merely because they have had little or no education
themselves, and that as for instilling pride or arrogance into
the minds of the lower and middling classes of the people,
by sending them to the London University, the very converse
must be the fact, because there is nothing that I see to be
derived from the institution at all likely to induce pride or self-satisfaction
in any of its members.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_314" id="Page_314">[314]</a></span></p>

<p>In the <cite>Times</cite> of Tuesday, I perceive an advertisement
from Mr. Dufief, stating that nearly 300 members of a class
in the London Mechanics' Institute are learning French
rapidly and critically. This, I conceive, so far from being an
absurdity, to be one of the most beneficial events ever
announced: consider what an improvement it will be for the
common run of people who frequent public places of amusement,
to find the lower order well grounded in French&mdash;in
that language they will, for elegance sake, carry on their
future conversations, and the ears of our wives and daughters
be no longer disgusted with the coarseness to which they are
now subject&mdash;for you are of course aware, that as the progress
of learning exhibits itself amongst the <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">canaille</i>, the
aristocracy will abandon the ground they assume, and our
belles and beaux, in less than a dozen years, will whisper
their soft nonsense in Hebrew, Sanscrit, Cingalese, or
Malabar.</p>

<p>But Mr. Brown seems not only to find fault with mental
improvement, but also with mechanical and scientific discoveries&mdash;he
sneers at steam and growls at gas. I contend
that the utility of constructing a coach which shall go by
hot water nearly as fast as two horses can draw it, at a
trifling additional expense, promises to be wonderfully useful.
We go too fast, sir, with horses&mdash;besides, horses eat oats,
and farmers live by selling oats; if, therefore, by inconveniencing
ourselves and occasionally risking our lives, we
can, however imperfectly, accomplish by steam what is now
done by horses, we get rid of the whole race of oat-sowers,
oat-sellers, oat-eaters, and oat-stealers, vulgarly called ostlers.</p>

<p>Gas too&mdash;what a splendid invention&mdash;we gain a magnificent
light, and ruin the oil-merchants, the whale-fisheries,
and the wax-chandlers&mdash;it is as economical as it is brilliant;&mdash;to
be sure we use more coals, but the coal-merchants are
all worthy men, and never take advantage of a frost to
advance the price of their commodity; coals are evidently,
however, not so essentially necessary to the poor as wax<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_315" id="Page_315">[315]</a></span>
candles; therefore, even supposing the price of coals to be
raised, and their value enhanced, we light our streets more
splendidly, and our houses more economically.</p>

<p>Mr. Brown seems to dislike the over-brilliancy of the gas
in the public ways, as tending to destroy the legitimate
distinction between day and night. I admit this innovation&mdash;but
let me beg to say, that until gas was brought to the
perfection it now is, for external illumination, we never
could see the unhappy women who are driven to walk the
streets at night, so plainly following their avocations, or ever
were indulged with the pleasing prospect of our watchmen
slumbering in their wooden sanctums, at the corners of the
streets.</p>

<p>Mr. Brown appears to dislike Mr. Mac Adam's improvements;
these I defend upon several principles; one which I
conceive to be extremely important, is, the constant employment
they afford to the sweepers of crossings, without whose
active exertions no man could ever pass from one side of the
street to the other; and another which I firmly believe to be
conducive to the improvement of the mind&mdash;I mean the
activity with which the eye, and the ear, and the understanding
must be constantly kept, in order that the individual
walking may escape being run over; superadded to which,
there is the admirable manure which the sweepings provide
for the land.</p>

<p>In short, most of the objects of Mr. Brown's vituperation
are objects of my respect, and I take the liberty of writing
this, in order that he may, if he chooses, enter into a public
disputation upon the several points at issue; for which
purpose, if he will direct a letter to me under cover to you,
I will appoint a time and place where the merits and demerits
of the present age may be temperately, calmly, and dispassionately
discussed between us.</p>

<p class="center">I am, Sir,</p>
<p class="right">
<span class="padr4">Your obedient servant,</span><br />
<span class="smcap">Richard White</span>.</p>

<h3 class="lsp2">PUNNING.</h3>

<p>It would be vain, at this time of the world's age, to enter
upon a serious disquisition into the "art or mystery" of
punning: it would be useless to argue upon its utility, the
genius and talent required for carrying it on, or the pleasure
or amusement derivable from it. The fact is self-evident,
that puns are an acknowledged ingredient of the English
language amongst the middling classes, and are, in their
societies, the very plums in the pudding of conversation.</p>

<p>It may be said that punning is a vice, and we are quite
ready to admit the charge; but still it exists and flourishes
amongst dapper clerks in public offices, hangers-on of the
theatres; amongst very young persons at the universities; in
military messes amongst the subalterns; in the City amongst
apprentices; and, in some instances, with old wits <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">razee</i>,
who are driven to extravagant quibbles to furnish their quota
of entertainment to the society in which they are endured.</p>

<p>A punster (that is, a regular hard-going thick and thin
punster) is the dullest and stupidest companion alive, if he
could but be made to think so. He sits gaping for an opportunity
to jingle his nonsense with whatever happens to be
going on, and, catching at some detached bit of a rational
conversation, perverts its sense to his favourite sound, so
that, instead of anything like a continuous intellectual intercourse,
which one might hope to enjoy in pleasant society,
one is perpetually interrupted by his absurd distortions and
unseasonable ribaldry, as ill-timed and as ill-placed as songs in
an opera sung by persons in the depth of despair, or on the
point of death.</p>

<p>Admitting, however, the viciousness, the felonious sinfulness
of punning, it is to be apprehended that the liberty of
the pun is like the liberty of the press, which, says the
patriot, is like the air, and if we have it not we cannot
breathe. Therefore, seeing that it is quite impossible to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_317" id="Page_317">[317]</a></span>
put down punning, the next best thing we can do is to regulate
it, in the way they regulate peccadilloes in Paris, and
teach men to commit punnery as Cæsar died and Frenchmen
dissipate&mdash;with decency.</p>

<p>The proverb says, "wits jump," so may punsters, and two
bright geniuses may hit upon the same idea at different
periods quite unconsciously. To avoid any unnecessary repetition
or apparent plagiarisms, therefore, by these coincidences,
we venture to address this paper to young beginners
in the craft, to the rising generation of witlings; and we are
led to do this more particularly, from feeling that the tyro in
punning, as well as in everything else, firmly believes that
which he for the first time has heard or read, to be as novel
and entertaining to his older friends, who have heard it or
read it before he was born, as to himself, who never met with
it till the day upon which he so liberally and joyously retails
it to the first hearers he can fall in with.</p>

<p>For these reasons we propose, in order to save time and
trouble, to enumerate a few puns which, for the better regulation
of jesting, are positively prohibited in all decent societies
where punnery is practised; and first, since the great
(indeed the only) merit of a pun is its undoubted originality,
its unequivocal novelty, its extemporaneous construction and
instantaneous explosion, all puns by recurrence, all puns by
repetition, and all puns by anticipation, are prohibited.</p>

<p>Secondly, all words spelt differently, having a similar sound,
which are carefully collated and arranged in a catalogue prefixed,
for the use of little punnikins at schools, to Entick's
small dictionary, of whatever sort, kind, or nature they may
be, are prohibited. Take for example:</p>

<p class="noindent">and so on.</p>

<p>In the next place, all the following travelling puns are
strictly prohibited:&mdash;</p>

<p>All allusions upon entering a town to the <em>pound</em> and the
<em>stocks</em>&mdash;knowing a man by his gait and not liking his <em>style</em>&mdash;calling
a tall turnpike-keeper a colossus of <em>roads</em>&mdash;paying the
post-boys charges of <em>ways</em> and means&mdash;seeing no <em>sign</em> of an
<em>inn</em>&mdash;or, replying, "Sir, you are out," to your friend who says
he does&mdash;talking of a hedger having a <em>stake</em> in the <em>bank</em>&mdash;all
allusions to <em>sun</em> and <em>air</em> to a new-married couple&mdash;all stuff
about village <em>belles</em>&mdash;calling the belfry <em>a court of a peal</em>&mdash;saying,
upon two carpenters putting up paling, that they are
very peaceable men to be <em>fencing in</em> a field&mdash;all trash about
"<em>manors</em> make the man," in the shooting season&mdash;and all
such stuff about trees, after this fashion&mdash;"that's a <em>pop'lar</em>
tree&mdash;I'll turn over a new <em>leaf</em>, and make my <em>bough</em>," etc. etc.</p>

<p>Puns upon field sports, such as racing being a matter of
<em>course</em>&mdash;horses <em>starting</em> without being shy&mdash;a good shot being
fond of his <em>but</em> and his <em>barrel</em>&mdash;or saying that a man fishing
deserves a <em>rod</em> for taking such a <em>line</em>; if he is sitting under a
<em>bridge</em> calling him an <em>arch</em> fellow&mdash;or supposing him a nobleman
because he takes his place among the <em>piers</em>&mdash;or that he
will <em>catch</em> nothing but cold, and no fish by <em>hook</em> or by crook.
All these are prohibited.</p>

<p>To talk of yellow pickles at dinner, and say the way to
<em>Turn 'em Green</em> is through Hammersmith&mdash;all allusions to
eating men, for <em>Eton</em> men, or <em>Staines</em> on the table-cloth&mdash;or
<em>Egg-ham</em>, are all exploded&mdash;as are all stuff about <em>Maids</em> and
<em>Thornbacks</em>, and <em>Plaice</em>&mdash;or saying to a lady who asks you to
help her to the wing of a chicken, that it is a mere matter of
<em>a pinion</em>&mdash;all quibbles about dressing <em>hare</em> and cutting it&mdash;all
stuff about a merry fellow being given to <em>wine</em>&mdash;or upon helping
yourself to say you have a <em>platonic</em> affection for roast<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_319" id="Page_319">[319]</a></span>
beef&mdash;or when fried fish runs short, singing to the mistress of
the house, with Tom Moore,&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<p class="verseq">"Your sole, though a very sweet sole, love,</p>
<p class="verse">Will ne'er be sufficient for me,"</p>
</div></div></div>

<p class="noindent">are entirely banished.</p>

<p>At the play-house never talk of being a <em>Pittite</em> because you
happen not to be in the boxes&mdash;never observe what a <em>Kean</em>
eye one actor has, or that another can never grow old because
he must always be <em>Young</em>&mdash;never talk of the uncertainty of
<em>Mundane</em> affairs in a farce, or observe how <em>Terrybly</em> well a
man plays Mr. Simpson&mdash;banish from your mind the possibility
of saying the Covent Garden manager has put his best
<em>Foot</em> forward, or that you should like to go to <em>Chester</em> for a
day or two&mdash;or that you would give the world to be tied to
a <em>Tree</em>&mdash;or that Mr. <em>Make ready</em> is a presentable actor&mdash;all
such stuff is interdicted.</p>

<p>In speaking of Parliament, forget Broom and Birch, Wood
and Cole, Scarlett and White, Lamb and the Leakes, the
Hares and the Herons, the Cootes and the Cruins&mdash;such
jumbles will lead into great difficulties, and invariably end,
without infinite caution, in an observation, that the conduct
of that House is always regulated by the best possible
<em>Manners</em>.</p>

<p>There are some temptations very difficult to avoid&mdash;for
instance, last Saturday we saw gazetted, as a bankrupt, "Sir
John Lade, Cornhill, watchmaker!" Now this, we confess,
was a provocation hard of resistance&mdash;when one sees a <em>lad</em> of
sixty-four <em>set up</em> only to <em>break down</em>, and perceives that whatever
he may do with <em>watches</em>, he could not make a <em>case</em> before
the Insolvent Debtors' Court; and moreover, since his taking
to watchmaking arose from his having, in the <em>spring</em> of life,
gone upon <em>tick</em>, and that the circumstance may be considered
as a <em>striking</em> instance of a <em>bad wind-up</em>&mdash;we admit that in the
hands of a young beginner such a thing is quite irresistible,
but such temptations should be avoided as much as possible.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_320" id="Page_320">[320]</a></span></p>

<p>We have not room to set down all the prohibited puns extant;
but we have just shown that the things which one hears,
when one dines in the City (where men eat peas with a two-pronged
fork, and bet hats with each other), as novelties, and
the perfection of good fun, are all flat, stale, and unprofitable
to those who have lived a little longer and seen a little more
of the world, and have heard puns when it was the fashion
to commit them at the west end of the town.</p>

<p>These hints are thrown out for the particular use of some
sprightly persons, with whose facetiousness we have been of
late extremely pestered&mdash;we apologise to our rational readers
for the insertion of such stuff, even by way of surfeit to our
quibbling patients.</p>

<p class="pfs80">CAUTIONARY VERSES TO YOUTH OF BOTH SEXES.<a name="FNanchor_56" id="FNanchor_56"></a><a href="#Footnote_56" class="fnanchor">[56]</a></p>

<p>My readers may know that to all the editions of Entick's
Dictionary, commonly used in schools, there is prefixed "A
table of words that are alike, or nearly alike, in sound, but
different in spelling and signification." It must be evident
that this table is neither more nor less than an early provocation
to punning; the whole mystery of which vain art
consists in the use of words, the sound and sense of which
are at variance. In order, if possible, to check any disposition
to punning in youth, which may be fostered by this
manual, I have thrown together the following adaptation of
Entick's hints to young beginners, hoping thereby to afford a
warning, and exhibit a deformity to be avoided, rather than
an example to be followed; and at the same time showing
the caution children should observe in using words which
have more than one meaning.</p>

<h3>FASHIONABLE PARTIES.<a name="FNanchor_57" id="FNanchor_57"></a><a href="#Footnote_57" class="fnanchor">[57]</a></h3>

<p>The season of festivities is arrived&mdash;the balmy breath of
Spring has called the dormant vegetation into life&mdash;the
flowers are bursting from their buds, the blossoms hang on
every tree&mdash;the birds sing melodiously, and the sun shines
brightly over the fresh foliage; in consequence of the completion
of which arrangements, everybody is coming to
London, in order to take the dust in the Parks, or pace the
burning pavement in the streets. Such is the order of things,
and shady groves and cooling grots are abandoned for drawing
rooms at ninety-six, and half-a-score sickly orange-trees
tubbed on the top of a staircase.</p>

<p>Thursday last was a fruitful day in the annals of our town.
Lord Dudley had a grand dinner&mdash;so had the Bishop of
London&mdash;so had Lady Sykes&mdash;so had Mrs. Bethel, and
so had half a score of the leaders of Ton. The Society for
the Relief of Foreigners in Distress (to which his Royal
Highness Don Miguel borrowed fifty pounds of Lord Dudley
to subscribe) had their anniversary feast at the City of
London Tavern; and the Chimney Sweepers of the metropolis
held theirs&mdash;contrast is every thing&mdash;at the White
Conduit House!</p>

<p>This last was amongst the most elegant affairs of the
season&mdash;every thing which could possibly have reference to
the profession was interdicted; black puddings and black
strap were banished; and when the amiable and excellent
Mr. Duck, after doing what few Ducks can do (we mean
stuffing himself with sage and onions), called attention to
Non nobis Domine&mdash;sung, the newspapers say, "by some
professional vocalists"&mdash;the grace was received by the fraternity
with <em>sootable</em> attention; that they did not exactly
understand it, Mr. Duck said was a misfortune, not a fault;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_323" id="Page_323">[323]</a></span>
but as he could almost see from the windows the chimneys&mdash;(loud
cries of Order interrupted the speaker)&mdash;the roof, he
meant, of that noble pile, the London University, he did
hope that before many years had gone over their heads, he
should find the younger branches of the profession to which
he had the honour to belong, bringing the dead languages to
life, and conversing <em>flue</em>-ntly&mdash;(Order, order!)&mdash;he meant
easily, in Latin and Greek."</p>

<p>"The immortal memory of Marshal Saxe and Sir
Cloudesly Shovel," were then given by Mr. Figgins, and
were shortly followed by the health of Mr. Brougham, who
was expected to have favoured the party with his presence,
but he was unable to get away from the House of Commons.</p>

<p>Mr. Duck felt it necessary to rise, in order to endeavour to
do away with an impression which had got abroad, that the
gentlemen of the profession disliked the introduction of
machines to supersede the necessity of climbing-boys&mdash;he
repelled the insinuation, although, added the Honourable
Gentleman, "if machines had been invented in my time, I,
perhaps, should not have had the honour of being here, for
I began at the bottom of the chimney and climbed my way
to the very top"&mdash;(loud cheers). "I dare say, gentlemen,"
said Mr. Duck, "you have heard the story of the humane
man who proposed to supersede the necessity of climbing-boys
by letting a goose down the chimney by a string, which
would, by the fluttering of its wings, effectually clean the
whole flue&mdash;the lady to whom he proposed this plan replied
that she thought it would be very cruel treatment of the
goose. 'Lord love your eyes, Ma'am,' said the professor,
'if so be as you are particular about the goose, a couple of
ducks will do as well!'&mdash;and, gentlemen, I never hear that
professional anecdote but I think of myself when I was but
a duckling, as I may say, and the laudable ambition into
which I climbed and climbed, and rose, as I may say,
like a phonix out of the hashes, until I reached my grand
climacteric."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_324" id="Page_324">[324]</a></span></p>

<p>Mr. Duck sat down amidst shouts of applause.</p>

<p>In the Old Times of yesterday we find the following
report of some part of the entertainment, which we were
unfortunate enough to miss&mdash;we take the liberty of borrowing
it:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>"Mr. Watson said that he was present, a few evenings since, at a
Lecture delivered by Dr. Birkbeck, on the utility of the machine to
supersede the necessity of the climbing-boy. The Doctor, he admitted,
argued candidly and fairly on the subject, and produced an improvement
in Glass's machine, which was unquestionably the best invention
of the kind; yet, with all its perfections, he (Mr. Watson) was convinced
that it would never answer the expectations of those who entertained
such a favourable opinion of its efficacy in cleansing chimnies. In the
course of the lecture the Doctor said that the machine must succeed in
all cases where it is used, if the prejudices of the master chimney-sweepers
did not interfere with the trial. It was true that the machine
so eloquently eulogized by the Doctor would answer in cleansing perpendicular
chimnies, but where there were impediments from various
causes, no machine, however pliable, would overcome them.</p>

<p>"Several master chimney-sweepers addressed the chair in the course
of the afternoon. One of them commenced 'I'm blowed, but if we had
Dr. Bucbuck, or whatever you may call him, here at our dinner, I
think we should soon make a conwert of him to our opinions. Gemmen,
I say it is impossible that ere chimney (pointing to the chimney in the
room) can be swept unless one of us goes up it; and I'll give you a
proof of it now.' The speaker here began to doff his long coat, and
would have run up the chimney in earnest, had he not been prevented
by some of his brother tradesmen, who caught hold of him by the legs
just as his body was about disappearing from the company. When he
alighted on the floor, he said that he did not mind a fig getting a sooty
shirt, so that he succeeded in showing the strangers present, how little
danger was to be apprehended in doing the work as it should be done,
and that was by encouraging climbing-boys. He had ascended upwards
of 5,000 chimnies in his life, of all sorts and sizes, and never yet met
with an accident."</p></div>

<p>"Archdeacon Pott and the Clargy of Middlesex," were
then given.</p>

<p>Mr. Duck then rose and said, "Gentlemen&mdash;we all of us
have known what it is to climb; and as my honourable
friend on the left says&mdash;I may say I have been up five<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_325" id="Page_325">[325]</a></span>
thousand chimnies, long and short, and never failed in doing
my duty to my employers&mdash;but what was it repaid me for
my toil&mdash;what was it that cheered me in my labour&mdash;the
sixpence as I got when I kimm'd down?&mdash;or the bread and
cheese the kitchen-maid would give me afore I went out?&mdash;No,
sir; it was not that&mdash;no&mdash;neither the one nor the other;&mdash;it
was the smile of ooman&mdash;lovely ooman, which rules us
all;&mdash;in her favour there is indeed a sweeping-clause; and I
have the pleasure to tell you, that there is a splendid
assembly of the dear creechurs a waiting in the next room,
ready to trip it on their fantastic toeses&mdash;so, if you please,
gemmen, we'll wind up the arternoon, by drinking&mdash;'Success
to the brush and shovel all over the world'&mdash;and
then join the fair."</p>

<p>To this proposal no possible objection could be made; and
the doors being thrown open, a most splendid collection
of the dear creechurs appeared ready for the quadrilles,
which commenced about five. The principal dancers
were&mdash;</p>

<h3>A DAY'S PROCEEDINGS OF A REFORMED
PARLIAMENT.</h3>

<p class="center">IMPERIAL PARLIAMENT,</p>

<p class="pfs80">Anno &mdash;&mdash;.</p>

<p class="pfs80 smcap">House of Commons, Thursday, Feb. 28.</p>

<p>Several new Members took the oaths and their seats;
amongst them we observed the Hon. Member for the District<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_326" id="Page_326">[326]</a></span>
of Field Lane and Saffron Hill, whose entrance was greeted
with huzzas, clapping of hands, and other demonstrations
of joy.</p>


<p class="p1 pfs80">PRAYERS.</p>

<p>Mr. Snob rose and said as how he thought it were a
great waste of time to okipy the Ouse with a lot of praying&mdash;he
thought that it would be quite as well and ample
sufficient that every member, on entering the Ouse, should
poke his face in his at and mutter a short jackerlation, sich
as was done in his parish church.&mdash;(Hear.)&mdash;He never did
no more when he was a churchwarden&mdash;(hear, hear)&mdash;and
he always found that it answered the purpose; and he gave
notice that, on Monday next, he intended to move that the
present practice be done away with&mdash;(cheers).</p>

<p>Mr. Ketch said he would sartinly second the motion
whenever it came before the Ouse.</p>


<p class="p1 pfs80">WAYS AND MEANS.</p>

<p>The Chancellor of the Exchequer intimated that on the
22nd of next month he should be prepared to submit his
plan of Ways and Means for the year. He could not then,
with propriety, enter into details&mdash;he would merely state
that it was in contemplation to repeal most of the existing
taxes (cheers from all sides), and this object would be easily
attained by suspending for the present the payment of the
interest on the funded debt&mdash;(immense cheering)&mdash;by the
sale of several supernumerary ships of war, and the materials
of some of the dockyards.&mdash;(Hear, hear.)&mdash;He anticipated
also a considerable sum from the disposal of superfluous
military equipments, cannon, &amp;c., which it would be the
height of folly to retain in these "piping times of peace;"
it would follow of course that very extensive reductions
would take place in the military establishments&mdash;(cheers)&mdash;<em>all</em>
pensions will forthwith be abolished&mdash;(Long-continued
cheering).&mdash;He laid particular stress upon the word <em>all</em>,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_327" id="Page_327">[327]</a></span>
in order that there might be "no mistake"&mdash;(a laugh)&mdash;and,
although there might be an apparent hardship in some few
cases, yet his Majesty's ministers had wisely resolved not
to incur censure from any person or party by using even
the semblance of partiality.&mdash;(Cheering, which lasted several
minutes.)</p>

<p>A Member, whose name we could not learn, rose, and
in the exuberance of his joy exclaimed, "Blow my wig if
ever I heard such a speech in all my life."&mdash;("Order!
Order!")</p>

<p>The Speaker begged to remind the Hon. Gentleman that
such expressions were not <em>strictly</em> in accordance with the
dignity of the House.</p>

<p>The Member apologized for having been led away by his
feelings, but this he would say, that whoever should now
venture to assert that His Majesty's Ministers had any other
than the benefit of their country in view, told a thundering
lie.&mdash;(Loud laughter.)</p>

<p>Mr. Gubbins said that he wholly and totally agreed with
the G'elman what spoke last&mdash;he thought that the thanks
of the community and the country at large are due to the
Right Hon. G'elman (the Chanciller) for his expozee; and
in order that their ancestors might see&mdash;(a laugh)&mdash;he
begged pardon, their posteriors&mdash;(roars of laughter)&mdash;well
then, their children's children and them as comes arter them,
might see the estimation in which that House had held him,
he would move that its freedom be presented to him in a
snuff-box of the value of five sovs., and he would subscribe
his bob.&mdash;(Cheers, and some laughter.)</p>

<p>The Speaker interposed, and endeavoured to explain to
the Hon. Member that there was no such thing as freedom
in that House, consequently his motion could not be put.</p>

<p>Mr. Gubbins said he supposed it would be unreglar to
argufy that pint with the Right Hon. Speaker, he would
therefore bow to the Cheer; he would not however be done
out of doing nothing, and with reference to the place repre<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_328" id="Page_328">[328]</a></span>sented
by the Right Hon. G'elman the Chanciller, he would
propose to bestow upon him the title of "The Bermondsey
<em>Screw</em>."&mdash;(Laughter.)</p>

<p>(As <em>all</em> our readers may not understand the point of this
pun, we should explain that in the Clink liberty, represented
by the Right Hon. G'elman the Game of Skittles is a
favourite amusement, and some of the Amateurs have a
particular mode of delivering the Bowl, which amongst the
cognoscenti is termed "A Bermondsey Screw.")</p>


<p class="p1 pfs80">NEW SOUTH WALES.</p>

<p>Mr. Cobbett having given notice, that on Thursday next
he should bring forward his motion (postponed on a previous
occasion) for a Committee of that House being appointed,
with instructions to proceed to New South Wales, for the
purpose of enquiring into the Administration of Religion
in that Colony,&mdash;</p>

<p>Mr. Lagg rose, apparently under great excitement, and
said that he could never consent that such a preposterous
motion should be entertained by that House even for a
moment. Was the Honourable Gentleman aware of the
privations and hardships which the Members of such a
Committee would have to undergo? He thought not&mdash;for
himself, he would say, that he had been a resident in the
neighbourhood of Sidney during the greater part of Fourteen
Years&mdash;(hear, hear)&mdash;"and," said the Hon. Gentleman, with
much emotion, "I will never willingly consent to go there
again, or recommend such a voyage to any of my friends."
He said he saw several Honourable Gentlemen around him,
whom he knew had been there as well as himself, and,
judging from his own feelings, he was quite assured they
would bear him out in his opposition.</p>

<p>Mr. Cobbett said, that under these circumstances he
should ask leave to withdraw his motion. (Leave given
instanter.)</p>


<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_329" id="Page_329">[329]</a></span></p>

<p class="p1 pfs80">NEW POLICE.</p>

<p>Petitions were presented from several parishes in the
outskirts, against the system of Police introduced by a late
Administration.</p>

<p>Several Members having risen at the same time to recommend
the attention of the House to these petitions, and all
asserting, with much vociferation, their right of priority, the
Speaker was obliged to interpose and call on Mr. Bumpus.</p>

<p>Mr. Bumpus said he thought there could be but one
opinion on the subject of this system, and that was, the
sooner it was abolished the better&mdash;(hear, hear,)&mdash;he said
that it required no oration to shew its baneful and unconstitutional
character; he thought he could not better exemplify
its true character than in using the words of a very intelligent
and interesting youth, the son of a tailor-chandler, who was
one of the officers of the parish in which he (Mr. Bumpus)
resided. "Addressing me" (said the Honourable Gentleman)
"you must understand, Gentlemen, this youth lisps very
much, these were his very words, says he, Thir, says he,
it is a miltuthy thythtem to thupport a arbituthy Government."&mdash;(Tumultuous
cheering.)</p>

<p>During the Hon. Gentleman's speech much mirth was
excited by the waggery of one of the members whom the
Hon. Gentleman had superseded. At every pause, the
Hon. Member exclaimed, "What a shocking bad hat!" &amp;c., &amp;c.</p>


<p class="p1 pfs80">NEW WRIT.</p>

<p>On the motion of an Honourable Member a new writ was
ordered for the district of Golden-lane, in the room of
Nicholas Briggs, Esq., deceased&mdash;(see our Execution Report
of Thursday last). The same Member also followed up his
motion by a notice that previously to the next Old Bailey
Sessions he should move that the laws affecting life in cases
of burglary should be revised with a view to their repeal.</p>


<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_330" id="Page_330">[330]</a></span></p>

<p class="p1 pfs80">POST-OFFICE.&mdash;FRANKS.</p>

<p>Mr. Pott said he had a motion to submit to the House, to
which, from previous communication with many Honourable
Gentlemen, he did not expect any opposition. Every
Honourable Member, he was assured, had already found the
advantage arising from the privilege of franking letters, and,
he was quite certain, had often experienced considerable
annoyance from the very limited number to which they were
at present restricted&mdash;(Hear, hear)&mdash;as well as the great
bore of being obliged to write the whole direction. He could
not conceive for a moment why they should be limited to
sending and receiving in the whole, the paltry number of
twenty-five letters each day&mdash;(Hear)&mdash;and that the weight
of each of such letters should be restricted to a particle
under an ounce. Some of the public officers, and, be it
observed, men virtually appointed by that House, were
privileged to send letters free of postage, without limitation
as to weight or number "and yet we, who, as I said
before, appointed those officers, are trammelled!&mdash;monstrous
anomaly!" He would not attempt to conceal that in bringing
forward the motion he would presently submit to the
House, he thought it probable that its adoption might be
attended with individual benefit to some of the Members,
and himself amongst the rest&mdash;he would deal candidly with
the House&mdash;he fully expected it would&mdash;(Bravo!)&mdash;and he
thought it but reasonable that men who were obliged to
sacrifice their time and their health for the good of the
country ought to have some ostensible means of repaying
themselves&mdash;(Hear, hear)&mdash;besides those bye-blows which
occasionally more or less occurred: <em>this</em>, he had every reason
to believe, would prove a positive benefit; and still better&mdash;it
would not depend on contingencies.&mdash;(Cheers.)&mdash;He would
not further detain the House, but would move, "That the
law or rule of the House (he did not care which it was)
which at present allowed Members of Parliament to send a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_331" id="Page_331">[331]</a></span>
limited number of letters free of postage, should forthwith be
rescinded, and that hereafter they should have the privilege
of sending as many as they may choose, without restriction
as to weight or number; and further, that it shall be sufficient
that members thus privileged should only be required
to affix their signatures to the address,"&mdash;(Much cheering.)</p>

<p>Mr. Bowditch said he should certainly oppose the motion,
even though he should stand alone. He, as principal officer
of the Post-office, had devoted the greater part of a long
life in endeavouring to perfect the details of the business of
that establishment, and at the same time to increase its
productiveness, and he viewed with dismay the attempt now
about to be made to render his exertions a nullity; independent
of the loss which the revenue would sustain, the
mail coaches were even now almost insufficient to convey the
bags, and the increased weight and bulk which the measure
now proposed would give, would render the thing perfectly
impracticable. He said he would not venture to characterize
the system at present practised by many of the Members of
that House in this particular, but when he saw the immediate
and eager use which certain newly-elected, reforming,
patriotic Members, made of this privilege for filthy lucre&mdash;(groans)&mdash;he
was filled with disgust.&mdash;(Great uproar.)
The Honourable Gentleman proceeded with much earnestness
for a considerable time, but the noise and confusion
was such, that we could only here and there catch a solitary
word&mdash;we understood him, however, to make some allusion
to "pattern cards," "samples of grocery," &amp;c. but could not
catch the context. Order being at length restored, the
Honourable Gentleman concluded by moving, as an amendment,
"That in future, Members of Parliament should only
be allowed to send five letters, and receive the same number
each day, free of postage, and that the weight of each of
such letters should not exceed half an ounce."&mdash;(Yells of
disapprobation.)</p>

<p>Mr. Van said that the objection of the Honourable Secretary<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_332" id="Page_332">[332]</a></span>
of the Post-office was perfectly ridiculous, as regarded the
probable insufficiency of the mail coaches; he would ask,
Would it not be an easy matter to alter the system of
coaches, and in their place adopt that of steam conveyance?
The number of railways with which the whole country was
now about to be intersected would render such alteration
a matter of the greatest ease, and one steam carriage would
be able to perform the work of a dozen mail coaches. (Hear,
hear, hear.)</p>

<p>The Chancellor of the Exchequer was quite taken by surprise,
and said, that although he could not sanction the
proposed measure, he clearly saw that in the present temper
of the House, opposition would be fruitless; he could, however,
have wished the hon. gentleman had communicated
his intentions to him before bringing his motion before the
House&mdash;the very lucrative situation of Receiver-General of
the Post-office Revenue had within these few days become
vacant, and he thought that had he been consulted, he could
have placed this subject in so feeling a point of view to the
hon. gentleman, as might have caused the present motion to
have been withheld.</p>

<p>Mr. Pott rose immediately, and said he thought it very
probable that he had taken an erroneous view of the subject,
and, with the leave of the House, would withdraw his
motion. (Cries of "No, no! divide, divide!") The gallery
was then cleared, and on a division the numbers appeared&mdash;</p>

<p class="center">
For the amendment, 3; against it, 296&mdash;<br />
minority, 293.<br />
For the original motion, 296; against it, 3&mdash;<br />
majority, 293.<br />
</p>

<p>This announcement was received with loud cheers, and
evidently to the great discomposure of the hon. mover.</p>

<p>On our re-admission, symptoms of a desire to adjourn
having manifested themselves,</p>

<p>Mr. Spriggins rose and said that, although there was an<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_333" id="Page_333">[333]</a></span>
evident inclination to toddle, he could not allow the House
to mizzle without putting in his spoke. He would stick to
the present Ministry like bricks and mortar. The Chancellor
of the Exchequer had proved himself a reg'lar out-and-outer;
he and his colleagues had shown they were down as a hammer,
and he had no doubt, in a short time, everything would be
right as a trivet.</p>

<p>The House rose at an early hour, it being understood that
one of the members had some heavy bets depending on a
match of bumble-puppy, in which he had backed his apprentice,
and which came off that afternoon in the neighbourhood
of Bethnal Green.</p>


<hr class="r15" />
<h3>CLUBS.<a name="FNanchor_58" id="FNanchor_58"></a><a href="#Footnote_58" class="fnanchor">[58]</a></h3>

<p>There have recently been published several very edifying
works upon "Etiquette," and the mode of behaving well in
company. As no book touching the conduct of Club society
has yet appeared, and this is the season of the year at which
those admirable institutions are making weekly acquisitions
in the shape of new members, we have thought it might be
neither superfluous nor disagreeable to give the recently
admitted candidates a few leading rules for their behaviour,
in the way of directions&mdash;Thus,</p>

<p>In the first place, find fault with everything, and bully the
waiters. What do you pay your subscriptions for, but to
secure that privilege? Abuse the Committee for mismanagement,
until you get into it yourself&mdash;then abuse everybody
else.</p>

<p>Never shut the door of any room into which you may go,
or out of which you may come.</p>

<p>When the evening papers arrive, pounce upon three; keep
one in your hand reading, another under your arm, ready to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_334" id="Page_334">[334]</a></span>
relieve that; and sit down upon a third. By this means you
possess yourself of the opinions of all parties, without being
influenced by any one.</p>

<p>If you wish to dine early and cheap, order some cold meat
just before three o'clock&mdash;it will then be charged as luncheon;
bread, pickles, &amp;c., gratis. Drink table-beer, because, as
the Scotch gentleman said of something very different, "It is
vary pleasant, and costs nothing."</p>

<p>If you dine on the joint, get it first, and cut all the best
parts off, and help yourself to twice as much as you want,
for fear you should never see it again.</p>

<p>If you are inclined to read the newspaper when you have
finished your meat, make use of the cheese as a reading-desk;
it is very convenient, and, moreover, makes the paper
smell of the cheese, and the cheese taste of the paper.</p>

<p>If you come in, and see a man whom you know dining
quietly by himself, or two men dining sociably together,
draw your chair to their table and volunteer to join them.
This they cannot well refuse, although they may wish you
at Old Scratch. Then call for the bill of fare and order your
dinner, which, as the others had half done before your
arrival, will not be served till they have quite finished theirs.
This will enable them to enjoy the gratification of seeing you
proceed through the whole of your meal, from soup to cheese
inclusive, while they are eating their fruit and sipping their
wine.</p>

<p>If you drink tea, call for a "cup" of tea; when the waiter
has brought it, abuse him for its being too strong, and
desire him to fetch an empty cup and a small jug of boiling
water; then divide the tea into the two cups and fill up both
with the water. By this method you get two cups of tea for
the price of one. N.B.&mdash;The milk and sugar not charged for.</p>

<p>If you are a literary man, always write your books at
the club&mdash;pen, ink, and paper, gratis; a circumstance which
of itself is likely to make your productions profitable.</p>

<p>When there is a ballot, blackball everybody you do not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_335" id="Page_335">[335]</a></span>
happen to know. If a candidate is not one of your own personal
acquaintance, he cannot be fit to come there.</p>

<p>If you are interested about a friend, post yourself directly
in front of his balloting box, and pester everybody, whether
you know them or not, to give him a vote; this, if pertinaciously
adhered to, will invariably settle his fate, one way
or the other.</p>

<p>Always walk about the coffee-room with your hat on, to
show your own independence, and your respect for the
numerous noblemen and gentlemen who are sitting at dinner
without theirs.</p>

<p>When you are alone in any of the rooms where writing
materials are deposited, help yourself to covers, note-paper,
sealing-wax, and black-lead pencils at discretion; they are
as much yours as any other member's, and as you contribute
to pay for them, what difference can it make whether you
use them at the club or at home?</p>

<p>When you go away, if it is a wet night, and you are without
a cloak or great-coat, take the first that fits you; you can
send it back in the morning when it is fine: remember you
do. This rule applies equally to umbrellas.</p>

<p>Never pay your subscription till the very last day fixed by
the regulations; why should the trustees get the interest of
your money for two or three months? Besides, when
strangers come in to see the house, they will find your
name over the fire-place, which will show that you belong
to the Club.</p>

<p>An observance of these general rules, with a little attention
to a few minor points, which it is scarcely possible to allude
to more particularly here, will render you a most agreeable
member of the Society to which you belong, and which it
will be right to denounce everywhere else as the most
execrable hole in London, in which you can get nothing
fit either to eat or drink, but in which you, yourself, nevertheless,
breakfast, dine, and sup every day, when you are
not otherwise engaged.</p>

<h3>MR. MINUS, THE POET.<a name="FNanchor_59" id="FNanchor_59"></a><a href="#Footnote_59" class="fnanchor">[59]</a></h3>

<p>The poetry of Mr. Minus could be compared to nothing
but the dropping of honey upon rose leaves, or the fluttering
of moths round the smoke of cinnamon;&mdash;it was so flippant,
so sweet, and so trifling. He had a round of set rhymes and
ideas, which, like the man who walked out in the morning in
a dress of crimson and gold, because he had no other, he
perpetually was using; such as</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry">

<p class="noindent">which species of versification having displayed <em>al fresco</em> after
dinner in lines "To a Mole upon Fanny's left knee;" "A
sonnet to half a jasamine flower;" "An ode to the wing of a
butterfly," and "An Epithalamium on the marriage of two
humming birds," (all of which were written, sung, composed,
and recited by himself) he obligingly sat down to the piano-forte
on their return, and gave the following air with infinite
effect:</p>

<p class="pfs90 smcap">Fanny's Bower.<a name="FNanchor_60" id="FNanchor_60"></a><a href="#Footnote_60" class="fnanchor">[60]</a></p>

<p>This Mr. Minus considered a <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">chef-d'œuvre</i>, and if he was
mistaken there was such a softness, a condescension and
pleasantry in his manners, as would have excused a more
serious error; as a companion, he was delightful; as a
man, honourable; and as a poet, fashionable.</p>


<hr class="r15" />
<h3>NATIONAL DISTRESS.</h3>

<p>In a late number<a name="FNanchor_61" id="FNanchor_61"></a><a href="#Footnote_61" class="fnanchor">[61]</a> we somewhat unfeelingly (it is hinted
by a correspondent) doubted, and even sneered at, the
universal topic, the national distress, with which we are,
it seems, overwhelmed; and when any suggestions of our
friends (backed by truth and reason) can be attended to,
we are always delighted to avail ourselves of them, and
recant our errors.</p>

<p>We have reconsidered the subject, and, during the last
fortnight, have visited the most diversified scenes of life,
and we feel bound to retract the "flippant doubts"
(those are our communicant's words), which we expressed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_340" id="Page_340">[340]</a></span>
as to the existence of general calamity, and are ready to
confess that we had no idea of its extent, particularly in and
about the metropolis.</p>

<p>The first object which tended to convert us from our
original prejudiced opinion on the subject, was the sight of
that most melancholy assemblage of people called "Epsom
Races." Upwards of fifty thousand of the most unhappy
of our fellow-countrymen, victims of tyranny and taxation,
no longer ago than the week before last, dragged
their wretched limbs to this sad and deplorable spectacle;
and the vast sums of money taken from some of them,
and the immense quantity of provisions and liquor which
the poorer part of the slaves were compelled to devour,
were unparalleled, we believe, on any former similar occasion.</p>

<p>It made our hearts bleed to behold our excellent and free-born
tailor driving, with great labour and danger, a tandem,
with two blood-horses; and we nearly wept when we found
that our bootmaker and his unhappy family could only afford
a barouche and four, hired for the day.</p>

<p>But we had, also, an eye to the agricultural part of the
question; and we were struck with horror and amazement
at the pale, emaciated, and threadbare appearance of the
broken-down farmers of Surrey, Berks, and Bucks, who
crawled out to the mournful scene upon their starving
ponies, for which some, in their despair for money, were
wild enough to ask seventy, eighty, and a hundred guineas
each.</p>

<p>At the inns on the road, the expenses the tax-ridden slaves
incurred were abominable. A hatter in Bond Street was
charged seventeen shillings a bottle for champagne; and a
wretched party of landholders in the neighbourhood of
Leatherhead, who have threatened to abandon their farms,
were driven by their grief to drink two dozen and four
bottles of that shameful imposition upon British credulity
called Chateau Margaux.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_341" id="Page_341">[341]</a></span></p>

<p>On our return from Epsom (having to cross the country)
we passed through Kingston. Woe, grief, and mendicity
there had established their tribunal. Petitions and remonstrances
were all in array; and, in order to give the
mourning victims of that devoted parish an opportunity of
assembling occasionally to grieve in unison, some sympathetic
philanthropists in the vicinity have built a theatre or
circus, wherein a Miss Hengler endeavours nightly to solace
their incurable woes, by dancing on wires, balancing
tobacco-pipes, and swallowing live cockchafers. Such an
expedient was never hit upon at this distance from town, till
the melancholy aspect of things in general pointed out the
absolute necessity of it in this wretched year.</p>

<p>During the week we thought we would go to some of the
London playhouses. We essayed Covent Garden. It was
Miss Stephens' benefit: "boxes full" stared us in the face;
the pit, too, was crowded with the more unfortunate classes
of society; and upon inquiring if we could make our way
into the gallery, we were told that both galleries had been
crowded with squalid wretches, in a state of actual starvation,
who had spent their last five shillings each that night
in paying for admission, for oranges, apples and nuts, which,
as everybody knows, is not the sort of food the noble and
free-born Briton is accustomed to. We sighed and crossed
the river, having been refused admission at Mathews's,
because the crowd of deplorable beggars who had sought
refuge in the Lyceum would admit of no increase.</p>

<p>At Astley's, a house we thought remote from woe, we
again applied. "There's standing-room at the back of the
boxes, sir," said a little round-shouldered man in black,
"but not a place in the pit or gallery." "Good heavens!"
we exclaimed, "and is there so general a calamity pervading
even the suburbs?" We turned into the road, where we
were stopped by a string of horsemen, and of gigs, carts,
and coaches, filled, inside and out, with the lowest and most
unhappy persons among the people, who had not chosen to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_342" id="Page_342">[342]</a></span>
assuage their sorrows in the theatres, but had preferred to
indulge their tender sympathies in a fight, some twenty or
thirty miles from town, to which the circumstance of the
times had induced them to transport themselves at the
nefarious expense, perhaps, of two or three pounds each.
But what made us shudder still more, was seeing that they
were, for the greatest part, in a state of intoxication, to which
they had no doubt been urged by the disastrous acts of that
empty pretender to politics, Pitt,&mdash;that weak man, Lord
Londonderry,&mdash;or that misguided bigot, Peel,&mdash;or some
others of those who are, or have been, at the helm of the State.</p>

<p>Having got clear of these, we crossed the bridge, and
turned down to the House of Commons: the doors were
fast&mdash;no house. Tried at the Lords: their lordships had
adjourned at seven. "Ah!" said we, "this is a new proof
of the truth of our friend's suggestions: these are noble and
wealthy men; there is no distress here&mdash;no crowds&mdash;no
misery&mdash;no assemblage."</p>

<p>We were baffled in our attempt to get up the Haymarket,
several thousand unhappy persons having dressed themselves
in diamonds, and lace, and gold, and pearls, and feathers,
and flounces, to weep away the night, in the body of the
Opera House. And at the Duke of Devonshire's wall, we
were obliged to abandon our hackney-coach, into which we
had stepped at the corner of St. James's Street, to avoid the
crowd of carriages, which had brought an innumerable host
of distressed families to his Grace's hospitable roof, in order
that their immediate necessities might be alleviated by some
Italian singing and <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Ponche à la Romaine</i>.</p>

<p>Some of the females of these wretched groups we happened
to encounter, and a more truly pitiable sight we never
saw; in the middle of the night were they straggling out of
the court-yard to look for their carriages, with clothes hardly
sufficient to cover them from cold, or answer the purposes of
common decency. To such straits our women are driven by
necessity.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_343" id="Page_343">[343]</a></span></p>

<p>Here our doctrine that even the highest were exempt from
sorrow fell to the ground, and we went to bed to dream of
woe.</p>

<p>Pursuing, the next day, our course through the town, we
dropped into the Somerset House Exhibition, where there
could not have been less than two thousand of our unhappy
fellow-creatures, who had paid, all of them, one shilling,
most of them two shillings, mewed up in close hot rooms,
with hardly space to move or breathe, and without the
smallest refreshment; nay, not even a crust of bread&mdash;not
even a drop of water to relieve them in their lamentable
condition.</p>

<p>At Belzoni's Tomb the mourners were in myriads; at the
Cosmorama several wretched-looking people were endeavouring
to pass their lingering hours by peeping through little
holes at coloured prints stuck against a wall. At the
Panorama&mdash;at the British Gallery, the same horrid scenes
were acting&mdash;the same deception was carrying on; and at
the Soho Bazaar it was quite moving to see the hundreds of
well-dressed suffering innocents who have been driven from
the best mercantile parts of the town to this secondary
quarter, merely because they are enabled, by this painful
humiliation, to purchase gauze, and coloured paper, and
bugles, and knitting-needles, and card-racks, and shuttlecocks,
and fiz-gigs, and the other necessaries of life, nearly one
hundred per cent. cheaper there than anywhere else in the
metropolis.</p>

<p>We passed from the neutral ground of Soho Square into
St. Giles's, where we saw an Irishwoman, somewhat elevated
with the private consolation of the afternoon, thumping her
husband about the head with a shoulder of mutton, because
he had bought it in preference to a leg, which she wished
for, while her four little starveling children (who had neither
beaver hats on their heads, nor red morocco shoes to their
feet), were playing with the motley tails of three full-sized
mackerel, upon which the famishing labourer had expended a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_344" id="Page_344">[344]</a></span>
portion of his hard-earned wages, by way of supper, which
the poor creature had told his spouse he intended to take,
that it might give him an appetite for his next day's dinner.</p>

<p>Just above these, in a room, the windows of which were
open, were a set of unfortunate creatures, who had, in
happier days, named themselves the "Sons of Frolic;"
these wretched persons were suffering under the dreadful
effects of civil dissension, which always creeps in with
domestic distress. That type of kings, the parish beadle,
had been sent for by the overbearing landlord, to secure the
most active of three of the members, who had just kicked
the waiter down stairs for having brought them up a corked
bottle of port wine. These distressed tradesmen, however,
were so far imposed upon as to be induced to make up the
affair by a present of three guineas to the waiter, and a pound
to the beadle. Still, exclaimed we, accumulation upon
accumulation.</p>

<p>We found in all the dingy streets about those rural and
unfrequented parts of London, Bedford, Russell, Red Lion,
Bloomsbury, Tavistock, and Brunswick squares, the same
congregation of carriages standing (and lights were on the
tables in the eating-rooms of the houses) at different doors,
which proved to us that the most respectable families, at this
period of distress, are driven to club together to get food
upon a principle of economy.</p>

<p>This remote passage led us towards Islington. At a
melancholy place, quite on the outskirts of the town, called
White Conduit House, many thousands of our fellow-mourners
were congregated in the open fields; night, too,
was coming on, and the poor children were drinking milk
just as it came from the cow, while their parents, equally
wretched, but more experienced in sorrow, were swallowing
the same succedaneum, made into a mixture called syllabub.</p>

<p>At Sadler's Wells the grief was raving&mdash;we heard the
lamentations at the distance of half a mile&mdash;crowds filled
even the lobbies; and such is the pressure of national mis<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_345" id="Page_345">[345]</a></span>fortune
at the moment, that a corn-factor was obliged the
night we were there to give fourteen shillings and sixpence,
hackney-coach-hire, to get his poor shivering wife and
daughters to their miserable cottage <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">ornée</i>, with a four-stall
stable, conservatory, and coach-house in the Kent-road.</p>

<p>We rested in our researches from that evening pretty well
till Whitsuntide, and then, indeed, conviction took full
possession of us.</p>

<p>To us who remember Greenwich park in the year 1792,
what a reverse!&mdash;then there were gaiety and sunshine, and
fun and amusement. In the first place, Whit-Sunday this
year was a wet Sunday,&mdash;a circumstance which, we are bold
to say, never occurred before the late Mr. Pitt's accession to
office, and very rarely even during his ruinous administration.
The conduct of the "talents" in this particular cannot be
cited, as only one Whitsuntide occurred during their splendid
career.</p>

<p>Our readers may conceive the gloom this oppressive mismanagement,
and evident disregard for the comforts of the
poor, threw over the quondam scene of gaiety; the people
surely might have been allowed to meet, and weep in comfort
in one of the Royal parks!</p>

<p>But if Sunday filled us with this feeling, what must
Monday have done, when nature interfering, to triumph over
the tyrants, gave the people a fine day? Then did we see
them loading every sort of vehicle, on the inner and outer
sides, driving horses, and donkeys, and ponies, and riding
them with all their speed and energy, to reach the once-loved
spot they had known in former days, and grieve all together
at our deplorable state.</p>

<p>When arrived there, how did they conduct themselves?
They threw themselves into the most extravagant postures,
rolling down hills, and running up again, throwing sticks
even at oranges and cakes, in hopes of getting something to
allay their hunger and thirst&mdash;some indeed we saw, decent-looking
persons, devouring with avidity fish, called eels,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_346" id="Page_346">[346]</a></span>
who themselves (poor victims!) are driven to wallow in mud
for their food, and first skinned alive, are next cut to pieces,
and finally exterminated by the hands of cooks as men are
by ministers.&mdash;What a striking resemblance there is between
an Eel and an Englishman!</p>

<p>At Richmond sorrow put on her deepest sables&mdash;hundreds
of devoted persons were crammed into vessels, encouraged by
Government as packets at our outports, in which the danger
of being scalded to death, burnt alive, or blown to atoms, are
added to all the other little <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">désagréments</i> of the deep.</p>

<p>Steam-boats are what they call improvements. They may
be in this age of redundant population: but what Government
is there on earth, except ours, who, for the chance of thinning
an overstocked nation, could have had the barbarity to
allow these craft to ply on the seas and the rivers, which
must wound the feelings and invade the rights of those
established captains of colliers and owners of coal-barges,
who, for centuries before, used to make their voyages satisfactorily
to themselves, but whose pride is now destroyed,
and whose vessels are treated like petitioners when applying
for relief to the great and mighty. Away puffs the nobleman
and the steamer, and all the suffering coal-bargemen or the
needy applicant gets for his manual labour, is a sight of the
stern of either, and a tremulous sensation, caused by the
swell of their passing power.</p>

<p>But to return to the more immediate effects of misrule.
The commons and heaths round the metropolis were sought
out, to change the wretched scene; and Blackheath, Hampstead-heath,
Hornsey-wood, and Norwood, were covered with
flocks of the populace, who had quitted their houses in
despair, and in one-horse chaises.</p>

<p>They, and indeed all those particularly around London,
seemed to join in a determined manifestation of the crisis of
affairs, which might, if anything could, we should think,
show Ministers the destruction, to the brink of which they
have brought desponding England. The same threat, it is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_347" id="Page_347">[347]</a></span>
true, has been held out to all preceding Ministers by sensible
Reformers for the last century and a half; and they, heartlessly
and senselessly, have, without feeling, disbelieved the
cry; but when, to all the calamities of peace, are added that
curse of nations, plenty, the blow naturally received by an
increasing revenue, and a decreasing expenditure; and, above
all, the heartrending proofs of popular misery, which we
have here selected; we think the present administration,
which has reduced us to this debased, degraded, and unhappy
state, will take warning in time. We give them fair notice&mdash;we
have done our duty in bringing the matter before them&mdash;we
shall say no more&mdash;if they are not wise enough to take a
hint, why "there's an end on't," and we give them up.</p>


<hr class="r15" />
<h3>HINTS FOR THE LEVEE.</h3>

<p>Dilworth's instructions to little boys and girls direct them
"never to be greedy, or swallow large pieces of meat, or eat
hot pudding." He, moreover, cautions them against many
little improprieties which shall be nameless; and concludes
with this impressive admonition&mdash;"never pick your nose in
company."</p>

<p>We have not room for all the instructions in the Scots
paper, which occupy more than three columns; but we shall
quote one or two, which appear the most important.</p>

<p>"<em>Directions for going to a Levee.</em>&mdash;Full suit, bag, sword&mdash;hair
powder is not held to be indispensable.</p>

<p>"Each individual will have two cards, one of which will
be taken care of by the pages in the ante-chamber, who will
have the care of the 'Court Record.' The stranger will then
walk through the suite of departments till he finds himself in
that immediately joining the presence chamber."</p>

<p>This, it will be perceived, is quite in the Dilworth style,
excepting that, instead of "not picking his nose," the pupil<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_348" id="Page_348">[348]</a></span>
is here directed to follow it; which, if he did, he would
arrive at the room he wanted, without such an elaborate
description.</p>

<p>The account of the reception the stranger is to expect is
not prepossessing, although correct enough in point of
fact:&mdash;</p>

<p>"The person on coming up to his Majesty drops one knee
to the King&mdash;the crowd being great he is immediately pushed
forward."</p>

<p>This our readers will perceive (as it is expressed), must
immediately upset him at his Majesty's feet; and the great
difficulty, instead of not picking his nose, will be "not to
break his nose in company." A consolation is offered to the
patient hereabouts, which is soothing enough:&mdash;</p>

<p>"He may pay his respects <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">en passant</i> to any of the Cabinet
Ministers with whom he is acquainted."</p>

<p>A privilege not confined, we conclude, to the place or
occasion. The truth is, that when the patient is up and off
his knees, he may expect to be pushed forward. At least,
we suppose, it is not intended, as the <cite>Star</cite> expresses it,
that he is to be pushed forward while on them, because a
more inconvenient opportunity of changing the form of presentation
could not have been selected, than when so many
gentlemen are likely to appear in the Highland costume.</p>

<p>The mode of preventing a crowd at a Levee, which the
<cite>Star</cite> mentions, is new and ingenious:&mdash;</p>

<p>"Every gentleman may appear in the dress of his regiment,
but it must be full dress, viz., a coat with skirts, etc.: any
person may easily see that unless some regulation of this
sort were enforced, the King's Levees would, on all occasions,
be crowded to an extent altogether destructive of comfort."</p>

<p>We do not see the force of this regulation, we confess.</p>

<p>Farther on we perceive this:&mdash;</p>

<p>"It is understood that Glengarry, Breadalbane, Huntley,
and several others, mean to attend the Levee 'with their tails
on.'"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_349" id="Page_349">[349]</a></span></p>

<p>This, to a Southron, sounds very odd; and the omission
of the Duke of Hamilton's name, on such an occasion, would
appear still more strange, if we did not explain that it is a
mere phrase, and indicates the proposed attendance of
dependants upon their chieftains.</p>

<p>We are fearful, however, that if these nobles bring their
tails with them, the regulation about wearing skirts will be
rendered unavailing, and that the skirts without tails, and the
tails without skirts, will have a good tough squeeze of it after
all.</p>

<p>The directions for the conduct of the ladies, upon the
present occasion, are clearer and more defined:&mdash;</p>

<p>"Ladies are introduced to the King either by Ladies who
have already been at Court, or by the Lord in Waiting. The
Lady drops her train (about four yards in length) when she
enters the circle of the King. It is held up by the Lord in
Waiting till she is close to his Majesty. She curtsies. The
King raises her up, and salutes her on the cheek. She then
retires, always facing the Sovereign till she is beyond the
circle. A considerable difficulty is presented to the inexperienced
by the necessity of retiring (without assistance)
backwards. The ladies must exert their skill to move their
trains quietly and neatly from behind them as they retire;
and those who have never worn such dresses should lose no
time in beginning to practise this. Most painful must the
situation be of a young female who is so unfortunate as to
make a <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">faux-pas</i> on such an occasion. It was by no means
so difficult when hoops were in fashion; but now that these
have been discarded there is nothing to assist in keeping the
train off the ground. The ladies cannot require to be
informed that they must all appear in Court plumes and fans.
At least nine feathers must be in each head-dress."</p>

<p>It will be observed, that the ladies are literally to come
with their tails on, as the gentlemen are metaphorically; and
the instructions how to "enter the circle of the King" are all
plain enough; but subsequently we are involved in a dilemma,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_350" id="Page_350">[350]</a></span>
from the fact that part of the instructions appear to have
been borrowed from a section of Dilworth, which we should
not have ventured to quote.</p>

<p>"A considerable difficulty is presented to the inexperienced
by the necessity (without assistance) of retiring backwards."</p>

<p>Now, retiring forwards, at any time, is a difficulty, and
better suited to the Irish than the Scottish Court; and therefore,
as all retiring must be going back, we are so dull as not
to see why "retiring backwards" (the very phrase used in
Dilworth) has anything to do with the "necessities" of the
moment.</p>

<p>The ladies are warned, it will be perceived, when the
necessity of retiring backwards comes upon them, to "move
their trains quietly from behind them," and they are desired
to practise this manœuvre. This is careful and decent, and
highly worthy of commendation, but the caution which
follows seems outrageous:&mdash;</p>

<p>"Most painful must be the situation of a young female
who is so unfortunate as to make a <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">faux-pas</i> on such an
occasion."</p>

<p>Dear heart! what could the <cite>Star</cite> have been dreaming of?</p>

<p>We have heard, in private letters from Edinburgh, that the
King's visit has turned the heads of everybody in that city;
and, therefore, we think the <cite>Star</cite> worthy of much praise
for endeavouring to teach them which way to turn their tails:
a lesson which, we trust, will be as profitable to them as it
has been amusing to us.</p>

<h3>THE INCONSISTENCIES OF CANT.</h3>

<p class="pfs80">AN ILLUSTRATIVE HISTORY OF ONE DAY.</p>

<p>In order to carry herself gracefully, and turn out her toes
in after times, the young pupil of the dancing-master is
placed diurnally upon a board, so contrived as to keep her<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_351" id="Page_351">[351]</a></span>
delicate feet extended at right angles with its sides; and,
with her chest expanded, and her head erect, the dear little
creature is made to stand for a certain period of every morning,
Sundays excepted. This is all very well in early youth,
and the pains endured in those days are amply repaid by the
admiration she afterwards excites at Almack's by the gracefulness
of her air and manner, the carriage of her body, and
the symmetry of her figure. Wretched, indeed, would be
the fair sufferer's case were she doomed from her teens
to her death to stand in the same little stocks, and
never enjoy the more liberal pleasures of her dancing days.
Such is the melancholy state of a considerate "saint,"&mdash;and
consider he must; for, if he considereth not, he sins.
But to my history.</p>

<p>A gentleman, plain, pious, and excessively virtuous (such
has ever been our aversion from mentioning proper names,
that we decline saying who), resident, however, in a suburban
villa, with a well-mown lawn in front, and charmingly-clipped
evergreens standing thereupon, a bright-yellow gravel
sweep to the door, a shining weathercock on the coach-house,
a large dog in the yard, an old peacock on a rail, and
a couple of enormous shells on either side of the entrance
steps,&mdash;a gentleman, we say, resident in such a house,
having descanted upon the horrors of slavery, lighted, last
Tuesday evening, his bedroom candle, and betook himself to
rest, his exemplary partner having preceded him thither after
family prayers. To doubt the quiescence of such a couple,
to imagine that anything could ruffle their serenity, or disturb
their slumbers, would be to libel the fraternity to which
our excellent friend belongs.</p>

<p>In the morning the exemplary man arose; and the first
thing he did when he went down stairs, was to look into his
hot-house, where he carefully examined a specimen of sugar-cane
which he had planted some months previously, with a
view to the cultivation of free sugar upon Dartmoor. He
then sat down to breakfast with his lady.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_352" id="Page_352">[352]</a></span></p>

<p>"Dear Rachel," said the exemplary man, "how excellent
this free sugar is. You get this, I presume, of William
Heywood?"</p>

<p>"To be sure, my dear," replied the partner of his joys.</p>

<p>"It is gratifying to think," said the husband, "that no
slave has been flogged to produce this."</p>

<p>Saying which, the mild and humane gentleman dropped a
lump of it into a cup of chocolate, upon which excellent
beverage, or the slave-labour required to cultivate it, he made
no observation.</p>

<p>"I have but one fault to find with free sugar," said the
lady, sighing.</p>

<p>"Name it," said the saint.</p>

<p>"It is fourteen-pence a pound, my love," said his spouse,
"and we can get better anywhere else for ten-pence."</p>

<p>"That signifies little, my dear," said the saint, "provided
we use nothing that has cost the slave torture." And then
he blew his nose with a cotton pocket-handkerchief. "Confinement
and slavery," continued the pious man, "are incompatible
with humanity and feeling." Saying which, he
walked up to the cage which held his lady's Jamaica parrot,
and indulged the moping captive with a lump of Heywood's
"free and easy."</p>

<p>At this moment his dennett was announced, and, rising
from his bamboo-chair, he proceeded to leave ten guineas
with his lady for a charitable donation;&mdash;he put on his hat
and gloves, and his amiable partner having attended him to
the door, as he stepped into the vehicle, expressed her tender
fears lest the slightness of the shafts should endanger her
exemplary husband's neck.</p>

<p>"They look very slight, dearest," said the "saint;"
"but they are perfectly secure, they are made of lance-wood!"</p>

<p>Consoled by this intelligence, she waved her lily hand, and
our pious friend went to attend a meeting of shareholders of
the Anglo-Mexican Mining Company, where he paid up his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_353" id="Page_353">[353]</a></span>
instalments, without taking the precaution of considering
what class of labourers must necessarily be employed in
working the mines. He proceeded thence to the sale of
East India produce, where he made several purchases, not
troubling himself to inquire how indigo flourished, or rice
grew; and, meeting on his way a director of the opulent
Leadenhall monopoly, accepted an invitation to dine with him
at the City of London Tavern.</p>

<p>Here he of course found an excellent dinner spread upon a
table of mahogany; his chair was of the same material. He
was helped to turtle and ate it with a silver spoon. To
gratify his palate he drank ever and anon iced punch, sweetened
he asked not how, and strengthened with rum. Over
his turbot he sprinkled Cayenne pepper, and flavoured his
cucumber with Chili vinegar. With a curry he called for hot
pickles, and having in the dessert refreshed himself with
some excellent preserved ginger, took a cup of coffee, and
concluding with a small glass of noyeau, stepped again into
his dennett, and reached his villa in safety, blessing the
names of Buxton, Wilberforce, and Macaulay, and receiving
the tender compliments of his affectionate wife upon the
virtue of drinking nothing but free sugar.</p>

<p>And this is what five hundred persons do, under the
guidance of the Liverpool speculators, and the leaders of
apes and asses in this metropolis. Let us merely point out
to such of our readers who like the followers of cant, and
will not take the trouble of thinking for themselves, those
inconsistencies which one day's adventures of our pious
"saint" develop.</p>

<p>Had he acted upon principle instead of policy, this
exemplary old body would have remembered that rum
and coffee, as well as sugar, are the produce of slave-labour,&mdash;that
his morning's chocolate and his afternoon's
liqueur have the same origin; he would neither have ventured
to trust to his lance-wood springs, nor have dared to
blow his nose with his cotton handkerchief; neither would<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_354" id="Page_354">[354]</a></span>
he in the morning after his hearty dinner, have been prevailed
upon to take a little tamarind drink to cool his
constitution, nor have allowed his apothecary to suggest an
exhibition of castor-oil if his indigestion continued; but even
if he had overcome these scruples, how would he have
summoned sufficient fortitude to put into circulation his
sovereigns and shillings, which, although our only circulating
medium, are furnished by the labour of slaves, chained to
their horrid work, lest they should risk the punishment of
death by endeavouring to escape the toil and climate to
which they are consigned.</p>

<p>It is with the slavery question as it is with the over-refinement
of all other feelings,&mdash;it only requires to be
looked into and analysed to be detected in all its flagrant
folly and absurdity. Had our pious "free and easy" sugar
friend followed up his own doctrine, he would long before
this have quitted his villa, disposed of his dennett, and retired
to some cave, where neither eating nor drinking, nor
furniture dyed with fustic and logwood, were required, and
have shown himself a sincere saint, an abjurer of all the
good things of this world, and a man of ten thousand; but
until we see the whole life of a man in the same keeping,
and find him equally scrupulous upon all points, and not
exhibiting his piety only where his mercantile prospects are
implicated, we must beg to avow our opinion that the "free
and easy" sugar system at fourteen-pence per pound, however
profitable to the grocer, and gratifying to the East India
proprietor, is neither more nor less than a contemptible
absurdity, and a most unqualified humbug.</p>

<h3>PRINCE PUCKLER-MUSKAU'S TOUR.<a name="FNanchor_62" id="FNanchor_62"></a><a href="#Footnote_62" class="fnanchor">[62]</a></h3>

<p>It would appear that the German publishers are before
even our own in the arts of the puff; at least we have not
yet seen a "fashionable novel" of the Burlington Street
manufactory ushered into public life with the trumpetings
of a first-rate English author. This "celebrated tour," as
the advertisements style it, has, however, the advantage of a
preliminary flourish from no less a person than Meinherr
von Goethe, who, among other things, extols the tourist
for the accuracy of his descriptions of English scenery and
society, particularly "the hunting-parties and drinking-bouts,
which succeed each other in an unbroken series," and which
"are made tolerable to us" (<em>i. e.</em> M. Goethe) "only because
he can tolerate them." "The peculiarities of English manners,"
continues the puff, "are drawn vividly and distinctly,
without exaggeration;" but how the sage of Weimar should
have fancied himself qualified to form so decided an opinion
upon the accuracy of his <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">protegé</i>, we do not presume exactly
to understand; inasmuch as we have reason to believe that
he has suffered eighty-three years of his youth to slip away
without availing himself of an opportunity of judging of our
peculiarities from personal experience.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>"Like other unprejudiced travellers of modern times, (he proceeds)
our author is not very much enchanted with the English form of
existence&mdash;his cordial and sincere admiration is often accompanied by
unsparing censure.... He is by no means inclined to favour
the faults and weaknesses of the English; and in these cases&mdash;(what
cases?)&mdash;he has the greatest and best among them,&mdash;those whose reputation
is universal,&mdash;on his side.</p>

<p>"The great charm, however, which attaches us to his side, consists<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_356" id="Page_356">[356]</a></span>
in the moral manifestations of his nature, which run through the book:
his clear understanding, and simple natural manner, render him highly
interesting. We are agreeably affected by the sight of a right-minded
and kind-hearted man, who describes with charming frankness the
conflict between will and accomplishment!" (What does the Patriarch
mean?)</p>

<p>"We represent him to ourselves as of dignified and prepossessing
exterior. He knows how instantly to place himself on an equality with
high and low, and to be welcome to all;&mdash;that he excites the attention
of women is natural enough&mdash;he attracts and is attracted; but his
experience of the world enables him to terminate any little <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">affaires du
cœur</i> without violence or indecorum."</p></div>

<p>We shall presently enable the reader to judge for himself
as to some points of this eulogy. Meantime, we turn the
leaf, and find a second flourish from&mdash;the translator of these
wonderful letters.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>"A rumour," says this cautious and disinterested critic, "has ascribed
them to Prince Puckler-Muskau, a subject of Prussia, who is known to
have travelled in England and Ireland about the period at which they
were written. He has even been mentioned as the author in the Berlin
newspapers: as, however, he has not thought fit to accept the authorship,
we have no right to fix it upon him, though the voice of Germany
has perhaps sufficiently established his claim to it. At all events, the
Letters contain allusions to his rank which fully justify us in ascribing
them to a German Prince."</p></div>

<p>After Goethe and the translator, or, in German phrase,
oversetter, comes the editor!&mdash;who, in the midst of some
would-be-pathetic cant, drops two bits of information, both
entirely false; namely, that "the letters, with very few and
unimportant exceptions, were written at the moment;" and,
secondly, that "the author is dead!" The editor adds that
there actually exist four volumes of this correspondence, but
from "various circumstances, which cannot be explained, it
has been found necessary to publish the two last volumes
first;"&mdash;the pair, as yet unprinted, containing his highness's
opinions and illustrations of London society, as these, now<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_357" id="Page_357">[357]</a></span>
before us, exhibit the "manners and customs" of the provinces,
and of Ireland.</p>

<p>As to the alleged demise of the author&mdash;Shakspeare
mentions a certain class of persons who "die many times
before their deaths;" and perhaps his highness may have
thought it as well to feel his ground with our provinces
before venturing upon what he calls "the <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">grand foyer</i> of
European aristocracy." However&mdash;unless the whole affair
is an impudent juggle&mdash;we are justified in fixing this performance
upon the Prince Puckler-Muskau; and we only
wonder how any English reviewer of the book could have
hesitated about doing so, provided he had read as far as
page 284 of the first volume, where we find our "German
prince" at Limerick, in company with Mr. O'Connell, a
relation of the great agitator.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>"We quitted the church, and were proceeding to visit the rock near
the Shannon, upon which the English signed the treaty after the battle
of the Boyne&mdash;a treaty which they have not been remarkably scrupulous
in observing. I remarked that we were followed by an immense
crowd of people, which increased like an avalanche, and testified equal
respect and enthusiasm. All on a sudden they shouted, 'Long life to
Napoleon and Marshal &mdash;&mdash;.' 'Good God,' said I, 'for whom do
the people take me? As a perfectly unpretending stranger I cannot in
the least degree understand why they seem disposed to do me so much
honour.' 'Was not your father the Prince of &mdash;&mdash;?' said O'Connell.
'Oh no,' replied I; 'my father was indeed a nobleman of rather an
older date, but very far from being so celebrated.' 'You must forgive us
then,' said <ins class="corr" title="Transcriber's Note&mdash;Original text: 'O'Connel'">O'Connell</ins>, incredulously; 'for, to tell you the truth, you
are believed to be a natural son of Napoleon, whose partiality to your
supposed mother was well known.' 'You joke,' said I, laughing: 'I am
at least ten years too old to be the son of the great emperor and the
beautiful princess.' He shook his head, however, and I reached my inn
amid reiterated shouts. Here I shut myself up, and I shall not quit
my retreat to-day. The people, however, patiently posted themselves
under my windows, and did not disperse until it was nearly dark."</p></div>

<p>We make no apology for anticipating here the arrival
of his highness at Limerick, because, by showing in the
outset the mistake that Mr. <ins class="corr" title="Transcriber's Note&mdash;Original text: 'O'Connel'">O'Connell</ins> made between the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_358" id="Page_358">[358]</a></span>
titles of Prince de la Moscowa and Prince Muskau, we
establish at once the identity of Goethe's "unprejudiced
traveller," and a "right-minded" and "decorous" terminater
of <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">affaires de cœur</i>&mdash;of whom many of our readers have had
some personal knowledge&mdash;and whose imposing mustachios
are still fresh in our own recollection. The cold nights of
November do not more surely portend to the anxious sportsman
in the country the approach of woodcocks, than do the
balmy zephyrs of May foretell the arrival of illustrious
foreigners in London; each succeeding season brings its
flock of princes, counts, and barons, who go the ordinary
round of dinners, assemblies, concerts and balls; yawn each
of them one night under the gallery of the House of Commons;
one day take their position on the bench at the Old
Bailey; visit the Court of Chancery; snatch a glimpse of
the House of Peers; mount St. Paul's; dive into the
Tunnel; see Windsor; breakfast at Sandhurst; attend a
review on a wet morning in Hyde Park; dance at Almack's;
try for an heiress&mdash;fail; make a tour of the provinces;
enjoy a battue in Norfolk; sink into a coal-pit in Northumberland;
admire grouse and pibrochs in Scotland; fly along
a rail-road; tread the plank of a steam-packet, and so
depart,&mdash;"and then are heard no more."</p>

<p>Such was this Prince Puckler-Muskau; and such were
his qualifications and opportunities for depicting that</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p class="noindent">"strange insular life which" (according to the clear and consistent summary
of M. Goethe) "is based in boundless wealth and civil freedom, in
universal monotony and manifold diversity&mdash;formal and capricious,
active and torpid, energetic and dull, comfortable and tedious, the envy
and the derision of the world!"</p></div>

<p>His first letter, addressed, as all his letters are, to his
"dear Julia,"&mdash;(that is to say, no doubt, his highness's
consort, Princess Puckler, to his alliance with whom, we
believe, he owed his princeship)&mdash;is dated Cheltenham,
July 12, 1828; and the first observation which his highness
is pleased to make upon his arrival at that popular watering-place<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_359" id="Page_359">[359]</a></span>
is one of a mixed character, political, statistical, and
philosophical, whence may be derived a tolerably fair estimate
of his highness's accuracy and knowledge of "things in
general." He is describing to his "dear Julia" the nature
and character of the distress amongst the lower orders in
England, and its causes and origin.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>"The distress," says his highness, "in truth, consisted in this: that
the people, instead of having three or four meals a day, with tea, cold
meat, bread and butter, beefsteaks, or roast meat, were now obliged to
content themselves with two, consisting only of meat and potatoes. It
was, however, just harvest time, and the want of labourers in the fields
so great, that the farmers gave almost any wages. Nevertheless, I was
assured that the mechanics would rather destroy all the machinery and
actually starve, than bring themselves to take a sickle in their hands, or
bind a sheaf, so intractable and obstinate are the English common people
rendered by their universal comfort, and the certainty of obtaining employment
if they vigorously seek it. From what I have now <ins class="corr" title="Transcriber's Note&mdash;Original text: 'told your'">told you,</ins>
you may imagine what deductions you ought to make from <ins class="corr" title="Transcriber's Note&mdash;Original text: 'newspape,'">newspaper</ins>
articles."</p></div>

<p>This valuable information is followed by an anecdote:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>"Yesterday, '<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">entre le poire et le fromage</i>,'"&mdash;(at what period of a
Cheltenham dinner that might be, his highness does not condescend to
explain)&mdash;"I received the twice-declined visit of the master of the
ceremonies, a gentleman who does the honour of the baths, and exercises
a considerable authority over the company of an English watering-place,
in virtue of which he welcomes strangers with most anti-English
officiousness and pomposity, and manifests great care and zeal for their
entertainment. An Englishman invested with such a character has
<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">mauvais jeu</i>, and vividly recalls the ass in the fable, who tried to imitate
the caresses of the lap-dog. I could not get rid of my visitor till he had
swallowed some bottles of claret with me, and devoured all the dessert
the house afforded. At length he took his leave, first extorting from me
a promise that I would honour the ball of the following evening with my
presence. However, I had so little inclination for company and new
acquaintances, that I made <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">faux bond</i>, and left Cheltenham early in the
morning."</p></div>

<p>Who the master of the ceremonies at Cheltenham, thus
uncourteously likened by his highness unto an ass, may be,
we have not the advantage of knowing; but certain it is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_360" id="Page_360">[360]</a></span>
that, however derogatory such an office might at first sight
appear, the characters and profession of some of the individuals
filling it prove that it is not so considered; and it is,
at all events, highly improbable that a gentleman, paying
an official visit to a foreign prince, would force his society
upon his illustrious host for a sufficient length of time to
drink several bottles of claret; and still more improbable
is it that any man&mdash;gentleman or not&mdash;could contrive to
"devour all the dessert the Plough at Cheltenham afforded,"
at a sitting. If, however, the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">arbiter elegantiarum</i> of
Cheltenham did really conduct himself in the manner
described, he followed the example of Hamlet with the
daggers,&mdash;he spoke of ceremony, but used none.</p>

<p>At page 14, we reach Llangollen, where his highness
is pleased to make an observation, which, coming from a
prince, sounds strange. He tells his Julia that "where he
pays well, he is always the first person!" "We represent
him to ourselves (quoth Goethe) as of a dignified appearance;"
but the landlords and waiters seem to have wanted
such discrimination. He then informs us&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p class="noindent">"that his appetite, enormously sharpened by the mountain air, was most
agreeably invited by the aspect of the smoking coffee, fresh guinea-fowls'
eggs, deep yellow mountain butter, thick cream, 'toasted muffins' (a
delicate sort of cake eaten hot with butter), and lastly, two red spotted
trout just caught; all placed on a snow-white table-cloth of Irish
damask;&mdash;a breakfast which Walter Scott's heroes in 'the highlands'
might have been thankful to receive at the hands of that great painter
of human necessities. '<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Je dévore déjà un œuf.</i>'&mdash;Adieu!"</p></div>

<p>It is laid down by Hannah, in "Hamilton's Bawn," that a
captain of a horse</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<p class="verse9">"has never a hand that is idle;</p>
<p class="verse">For the right holds the sword, and the left holds the bridle;"</p>
</div></div></div>

<p class="noindent">and we infer, from the animated account given by his
highness of his own activity, that he must have been either<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_361" id="Page_361">[361]</a></span>
a dragoon or a hussar, for, while with one hand he is
describing to the sentimental Julia the delights of his breakfast,
he is, by his own showing, actually eating an egg with
the other.&mdash;His notion of being served with guinea-fowls'
eggs we presume to have arisen from the price which the
innkeeper charged for them, for although eggs are plenty
in Wales, princes are scarce; but what his highness means
by describing Sir Walter Scott as a great painter of human
necessities, is quite beyond us.&mdash;After breakfast, he impudently
intrudes himself on Lady Eleanor Butler and Miss
Ponsonby, and quizzes them and their pretty cottage in
a style which, all the circumstances considered, one might
almost be tempted to call brutal. Those amiable spinsters
are, however, no more&mdash;and we may pass on.</p>

<p>By a reference to page 27, we find that his highness slept
"admirably," on the night of the 15th of August, at his inn
in Wales, where he describes himself sitting at the window,
looking at the sea, and the ships thereon. "On the landward"&mdash;whatever
that means&mdash;he says, "rises a castle of
black marble, surrounded by ancient oaks." And in this retirement
he finds, "very unexpectedly,"&mdash;we should think so,&mdash;a
"thin" friend of his, with "magnificent calves, elegantly
dressed;" a gentleman who is "so good-natured and yet so
sarcastic, so English and yet so German," etc., etc.; and this
so delightful personage tells him a story, which, in order
to fill up a certain number of pages, his highness is good
enough to repeat, though it contains nothing worthy of
notice, except an ill-natured slap at the poor Duke of
St. Albans, who treated him with every mark of civility
when he was in England.</p>

<p>His highness is tempted to visit the marble castle which
he has seen from his window, and is "remarkably well
received there."</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>"The bells of the various rooms," says his highness, "are suspended
in a row on the wall, numbered, so that it is immediately seen in what
room any one has rung; the sort of pendulum which is attached to each<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_362" id="Page_362">[362]</a></span>
wire continues to vibrate for ten minutes after the sound has ceased, to
remind the sluggish of their duty."</p>

<p>"The females of the establishment," continues his highness, "have
also a large common room, in which, when they have nothing else to do,
they sew, knit, and spin; close to this is a closet for washing the glass
and china, which comes within their province. Each of them, as well as
of the man-servants, has her separate bed-chamber in the highest story.
Only the housekeeper and the butler have distinct apartments below.
Immediately adjoining that of the housekeeper, is a room where coffee is
made, and the store-room, containing everything requisite for breakfast,
which important meal, in England, belongs specially to her department....
Near the butler's room is his pantry, a spacious fire-proof room
with closets on every side for the reception of the plate, which he cleans
here, and the glass and china used at dinner, which must be delivered
back into his custody as soon as it is washed by the women. All these
arrangements are executed with the greatest punctuality. A locked
staircase leads from the pantry into the beer and wine cellar, which is
likewise under the butler's jurisdiction."</p></div>

<p>Of the cordiality of his highness's reception at the marble
castle we have no doubt; but he leaves us in the dark
as to whether he had been the guest of the housekeeper
or the butler, though we confess we rather incline to the
former, not only because, according to his guarantee, the
author of the "Sorrows of Werter," he attracted women and
was attracted by them, because he refers, with something of
a regretful feeling, to the "locked staircase" of the wine-cellar:
had the butler been at home, there is every reason
to hope that his highness would not have found it closed
against him, but, like another Archer, would have been
kindly welcomed by the Cambrian Scrub.</p>

<p>His highness next visits a slate-quarry, over which he tells
us it "took him a considerable time to take even a hasty
glance." He then gives us the average of casualties which
happen annually, and breaks off into a profane medley of
nonsense, impiously entitled "Reflections of a Pious Soul,"
upon which we decline commenting, lest we should be
compelled to extract even the smallest portion of it.</p>

<p>In his highness's account of Carnarvon Castle we are<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_363" id="Page_363">[363]</a></span>
favoured with an historical fact so interesting and so new
withal, that we must extract it bodily, from page 77; which
page is moreover ostentatiously headed, "Origin of the Prince
of Wales's Motto."</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>"On descending, my guide showed me the remains of a vaulted
chamber, in which, according to tradition, Edward II., the first Prince
of Wales, was born. The Welsh, in consequence of the oppressions of
English governors in the earlier times of partial and momentary conquest,
had declared to the king that they would obey none but a prince of their
own nation. Edward therefore sent for his wife Eleanor in the depth of
winter, that she might lie-in in Caernarvon Castle. She bore a prince;
upon which the king summoned the nobles and chiefs of the land, and
asked them solemnly whether they would submit to the rule of a prince
who was born in Wales, and could not speak a word of English. On
their giving a joyful and surprised assent, he presented to them his newborn
son, exclaiming in broken Welsh, <em>Eich dyn!</em> <em>i.e.</em>, 'This is your
man!' which has been corrupted into the present motto of the English
arms, <em>Ich Dien</em>."</p></div>

<p>It seems hardly worth while detailing the true history
of this motto, since every child knows it&mdash;yet to prove,
on the spot, the deplorable ignorance of this pretender,
every child does know that the distinguishing device of
the Prince of Wales (having nothing to do with the English
arms), viz., the plume of three ostrich feathers, with the
motto Ich Dien, which, in Prince Puckler's own mother-tongue,
signifies 'I serve,' was assumed by Edward the
Second's grandson, the Black Prince, in memory of the
death of John, king of Bohemia, the lawful owner of the
said device, in the battle of Cressy. One might have
expected a little heraldry at least from the Château of
Thonderdentronck.</p>

<p>Ten pages of stupid blasphemy bring us to page 88, where
the baser propensities of his mind give place to its overweening
passion&mdash;personal vanity. The hero of "moral manifestations"
thus confides to his dear princess the conquest
he has made of a bar-maid at Bangor:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>"I had read thus far when the little Eliza appeared with my breakfast,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_364" id="Page_364">[364]</a></span>
and with an arch good-nature bid me good morning 'after my
long sleep.' She had just been to church, had all the consciousness of
being well dressed, and was waiting upon a foreigner; three things
which greatly incline women to be tender-hearted. She accordingly
seemed almost embarrassed when I inquired about my departure early
the following morning.... After dinner I went, under her guidance,
to visit the walks round the town. One of these is most romantically
placed on a large rock. We saw from hence Snowdon, in almost transparent
clearness, undimmed by a single cloud.... After this
pastoral walk, tender mutton closed the day."</p></div>

<p>Who is not inclined to exclaim with the Welsh, according
to his highness's version, "Eich dyn!" This is your man!</p>

<p>Skipping some more blasphemies, we find ourselves at
Kennell Park, the seat of Colonel Hughes.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>"Towards evening," says his highness, "I arrived at the house of my
worthy colonel&mdash;a true Englishman in the best sense of the word"
(from being a Welshman, we presume). "He and his amiable family
received me in the friendliest manner. Country gentlemen of his class,
who are in easy circumstances, (with us they would be thought rich,)
and fill a respectable station in society; who are not eager and anxious
pursuers of fashion in London, but seek to win the affection of their
neighbours and tenants; whose hospitality is not mere ostentation;
whose manners are neither 'exclusive' nor outlandish, but who find
their dignity in a domestic life polished by education and adorned by
affluence, and in the observance of the strictest integrity; such form the
most truly respectable class of Englishmen. In the great world of
London, indeed, they play an obscure part; but on the wide stage of
humanity, one of the most noble and elevated that can be allotted to
man. Unfortunately, however, the predominance and the arrogance of
the English aristocracy is so great, and that of fashion yet so much more
absolute and tyrannous, that such families, if my tribute of praise and
admiration were ever to fall under their eye, would probably feel less
flattered by it, than they would be if I enumerated them among the
leaders of <em>ton</em>."&mdash;Pp. 137, 138.</p></div>

<p>Little did his highness think that a few short months only
would elapse before the brow of his "worthy colonel, filling
a respectable station in society," would be encircled with
a baronial coronet; little did he imagine that his "country
gentleman," who "played an obscure part" in London, was so
soon to be converted into one of the "leaders of <em>ton</em>," from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_365" id="Page_365">[365]</a></span>
amongst whom he had so flatteringly excluded him; little
did he think that his hospitable friend was destined so soon
to adorn the British peerage as Lord Dinorben.</p>

<p>On the 5th of August he walked, while all the rest of the
family were yet in bed, "with the charming little Fanny, the
youngest daughter of the house, who is not yet out."&mdash;"She
took me," says his highness, "round the park and garden,
and showed me her dairy and aviary." His highness then
describes the dairy, which, we presume, from a laudable
desire of the "worthy colonel" to bring the article into fashion,
is surrounded with lumps of copper, forming "a gorgeous bed
for rare and curious plants." His highness enumerates the
comforts of the colonel's cocks and hens, and the ducks and
the pigeons&mdash;he feels at the sight thereof a fit of "pastoral
sensibility" come over him, and "turns homewards to get
rid of his fit of romance before breakfast:"&mdash;"Miss Fanny,"
he adds, "exclaimed, with true English pathos,</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<p class="verse">'We do but row,</p>
<p class="verse">And we are steered by fate.'"</p>
</div></div></div>

<p class="noindent">"Yes, indeed, thought I," says the prince, "the little philosopher
is right&mdash;things always turn out differently from what
one intends, even in such small events as these." What "the
little philosopher" meant by her pathetic exclamation, we
cannot, of course, divine; nor what his highness alludes to
as an event; but the story, as his highness has here printed
and published it, may serve as a caution to Lord Dinorben
how he suffers the familiar visits of princes, and subjects
himself to the jokes of such illustrious personages as feel
themselves privileged, in return for the honour they confer
upon him by their presence, to laugh at his "want of <em>ton</em>,"
and ridicule the kindnesses which "people of his class"
are so apt to bestow.</p>

<p>After dinner the prince tells us that he mounted the
colonel's horse&mdash;"unwearied as a machine of steel,"&mdash;(copper
would have been as fair a simile):&mdash;he gallops over the
stones, up hill and down,&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_366" id="Page_366">[366]</a></span></p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p class="noindent">"leaps with undisturbed composure over the gates which continually
intercept my way across the fields and tires me long before he feels
the least fatigue himself. This, to me, is the true pleasure of riding&mdash;[a
friend's horse]&mdash;I love to traverse mile after mile of country which I
had never seen before, where I know not whither I am going, and must
find out my way back as I can."</p></div>

<p class="noindent">But will it be believed, notwithstanding the comfort, the
good cheer, the aviary, the dairy, the untireable horse, etc.,
etc.,&mdash;the prince, although he had promised to stay with
the "worthy colonel" for some weeks, gets amazingly bored,
and "therefore took leave;" and had been, as he intimates, so
<em>genêd</em> by <ins class="corr" title="Transcriber's Note&mdash;Original text: 'Kenmell Park'">Kennell Park</ins>, that, proceeding from it to the house
of "another gentleman who had invited him," he makes his
visit "of some hours instead of days."</p>

<p>This grateful recipient of Cambrian hospitality is presently
discovered at the seat of Mr. Owen Williams, where he is
obliged to amuse himself "after dinner with reading the
newspaper." This slur upon the gaiety and conviviality of
Mr. Williams's table must be as groundless as is an assertion
which he also hazards, that there was nothing for dinner but
fish&mdash;and that after dinner oysters formed the dessert. But
whether it be true that his highness felt dull and was driven
to the newspaper, or not, glad we are that he has said he
was; for he favours us with an extract from the journal,
whatever it might have been, which affords a new and convincing
proof of the universal correctness of his highness's
information and remarks:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>"In this vast desert [the newspaper] I met with only one thing which
I think worth quoting to you. The article treated of the speech from
the throne, in which were the words 'The Speaker is commanded to
congratulate the people on their universal prosperity.' 'This,' says
the writer, 'is too insolent; openly to make a jest of the miseries
of the people.' It is indeed a settled point, that truth is never
to be expected in a speech from the throne; and if ever a king were
mad enough to wish to speak the real truth on such an occasion, he
must begin his speech, 'My knaves and dupes,' instead of the wonted
exordium, 'My lords and gentlemen.'"</p></div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_367" id="Page_367">[367]</a></span></p>

<p>That no such words appeared in any king's speech as
those which his highness is pleased to comment upon, we need
not take the trouble to say; but it is rather strange, since
we have already recorded his highness's view of the real
causes of popular distress in this country, that he should so
entirely coincide in the vindictiveness of the supposed newspaper
upon the fictitious expression.</p>

<p>We next find the prince visiting Colonel Hughes's copper-mines;
and, while he is standing by the furnace, he receives
an invitation from the colonel's brother, the major-commandant
of the loyal Chester local militia, to dine with him.
His highness not only declines the invitation, which he was
quite at liberty to do, but sneers at the hospitality which
was offered him; and forthwith starts from Lord Dinorben's
copper pots for Holyhead, to embark for Dublin; where,
after a dose of sea-sickness, he arrives in good preservation.
He says&mdash;"As I knew not what else to do&mdash;(for all the
notables who inhabit the town are in the country)&mdash;I visited
a number of show-places; and among the first was the
theatre,&mdash;a very pretty house, with a somewhat less rough
and obstreperous audience than in London!" <em>Eich dyn!</em></p>

<p>The descriptions which the "attracting and attracted"
prince gives to "Julia" of his little adventures during his
rides upon the horses of his friends are edifying. In Wales
he discovers a sylph weeding in a field, half naked, but "shy
as a roe, and chaste as a vestal." In Ireland he meets with
another interesting female, whose personal and mental
qualities he thus details to his "beloved soul:"&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>"The scene was yet further animated by a sweet-looking young
woman, whom I discovered in this wild solitude, busied in the humble
employment of straw-plaiting. The natural grace of the Irish peasant-women,
who are often truly beautiful, is as surprising as their dress, or
rather the want of dress; for though it was very cold on these hills,
the whole clothing of the young woman before me consisted of a large
very coarse straw hat, and literally two or three rags of the coarsest
sackcloth, suspended under the breast by a piece of cord, and more than
half disclosing her handsome person. Her conversation was cheerful,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_368" id="Page_368">[368]</a></span>
sportive, and witty; perfectly unembarrassed, and, in a certain sense,
free; but you would fall into a great error if you inferred from that
any levity or looseness of conduct. The women of this class in Ireland
are, almost universally, extremely chaste, and still more disinterested."</p></div>

<p>Truly, indeed, does the illustrious Goethe say, that this
prince knew how to put himself on a level with the highest
and lowest. We are, however, compelled to quit this rustic,
half-clad Venus for brighter scenes and more intellectual
pleasures. On his return from his ride, his highness proceeds
to call on Lady Morgan, who receives him with much grace
and urbanity.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>"I was very eager (says the distinguished stranger) to make the acquaintance
of a woman whom I rate so highly as an authoress. I found
her, however, very different from what I had pictured her to myself.
She is a little, frivolous, lively woman, apparently between thirty and
forty, neither pretty nor ugly, but by no means disposed to resign all
claim to the former, and with really fine and expressive eyes. She has
no idea of '<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">mauvaise honte</i>' or embarrassment; her manners are not
the most refined, and affect the 'aisance' and levity of the fashionable
world, which, however, do not sit calmly or naturally upon her. She
has the English weakness, that of talking incessantly of fashionable
acquaintances, and trying to pass for very '<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">recherchée</i>,' to a degree quite
unworthy of a woman of such distinguished talents; she is not at all
aware how she thus underrates herself.</p>

<p>"She is not difficult to know, for, with more vivacity than good taste,
she instantly professes perfect openness, and especially sets forth on
every occasion her liberalism and her infidelity; the latter of the somewhat
obsolete school of Helvetius and Condillac. In her writings she
is far more guarded and dignified than in her conversation. The satire
of the latter is, however, not less biting and dexterous than that of her
pen, and just as little remarkable for a conscientious regard to truth."</p></div>

<p>Now is this fair?&mdash;is this gallant?&mdash;is it princely?&mdash;is it
gentlemanlike?&mdash;hunted, followed, worshipped, and besought
as his highness was by Lady Morgan; dogged, baited,
ferreted out, and <em>fêted</em> as he had been, was it to be expected
that he would denounce his kind hostess as frivolous, affected,
a liberal and an infidel,&mdash;(and <em>he</em> too, of all men in the
world)&mdash;with more vivacity than taste, and no regard for
truth!&mdash;and, worst of all, "neither pretty nor ugly!"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_369" id="Page_369">[369]</a></span></p>

<p>He does, indeed, slily drop one lump of sugar into his
bowl of gall, and thinking he knows her ladyship's mind to
a nicety, no doubt believes that the one sweet drop will
"property the whole." "She is apparently between thirty
and forty." Miss Owenson, however, was an established
authoress six-and-twenty years ago; and if any lady, player's
daughter or not, knew what she knew when she wrote and
published her first novels, at eight or nine years' of age,
(which Miss Owenson must have been at <em>that</em> time, according
to the prince's calculation,) she was undoubtedly such a
juvenile prodigy as would be quite worthy to make a "case"
for the <cite>Gentleman's Magazine</cite>, and as fit to fill a show-waggon
at Bartholomew Fair, as her ladyship's namesake who was
born with double joints, and could lift a sack of corn with
her teeth when she was only six years old.</p>

<p>His highness now determines to explore County Wicklow,
and starts for Bray,&mdash;"a town twenty miles from Dublin!"&mdash;having
"left his carriage and people in town."&mdash;Of this
carriage and people we are often told much, and they seem
to give him no more trouble or inconvenience in the management
of them than his hat or his gloves,&mdash;when he wants
them he has them,&mdash;when he does not, they vanish into thin
air. What did he do with his "carriage and people" while
he was flirting with the barmaid at Bangor? When did
they cross the water to Ireland? for we have seen he came
quite alone through Wales; and we shall see presently that
he made all his excursions in Ireland in noddies, jingles,
jaunting cars, and went back quite alone through England
upon the tops of coaches. But, not to dwell on such trifles&mdash;for
we suppose one might, without much injury, say, both
of "principality" and of "people," <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">de minimis non curat
Prætor</i>&mdash;let us attend his highness (or, to give him the exact
title which the Germans bestow on princes of this calibre,
"his thorough-illustriousness,") to his supper-table at Bray.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>"I supped with a young parson of good family, who made me laugh
heartily at his orthodoxy in matters of religion, interspersed with talk,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_370" id="Page_370">[370]</a></span>
which was by no means remarkable for severe decorum of virtue. But
such is the piety of Englishmen (<em>qu. ?</em>)&mdash;it is to them at once a party
matter and an affair of good manners; and as in politics they follow
their party implicitly, through thick and thin, reasonable and unreasonable,
because it is their party;&mdash;as they submit to a custom for ever
because it is a custom; so they regard their religion, (without the least
tincture of poetry,) in exactly the same point of view: they go to
church on Sundays, just as regularly as they dress every day for
dinner; and regard a man who neglects church, just in the same light
as one who eats fish with a knife."</p></div>

<p>We may afford to despise this infidel's sneer at English
piety. As for his ideas of English manners, the secret of his
"thorough-lustre" on that head now begins to peep out.
He had evidently been studying the poor puppyisms of what
has been well enough called "the silver-fork school of
novelists." In the genuine spirit of the doctors of this
precious "sapientia," he says,&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>"The common people in England put the knife as well as the fork to
their mouths. The higher classes, on the contrary, regard this as the
true sin against the Holy Ghost, and cross themselves internally when
they see a foreign ambassador now and then eat so;&mdash;it is an affront to
the whole nation."</p></div>

<p>This specimen of his highness's "decorum" is sufficient.
With reference to his highness's horsemanship, we leave the
following exploit of the succeeding morning to the consideration
of the reader:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>"About a mile and a half farther on, the path suddenly ends in a
ha-ha, over which my horse utterly refused to leap. As the wall was
on my side, and the turf below very soft, I hit upon a new expedient;
I tied my handkerchief over the eyes of the refractory beast, and pushed
him down backwards over the wall. He was very little frightened, and
not at all hurt by the fall, as I had expected, and grazed peaceably
blindfold till I rejoined him. This manœuvre saved me at least five
miles." (No doubt German miles.)</p></div>

<p>We presume this experiment was performed upon a friend's
horse. In the execution, however, of his "new expedient,"
he had, it appears, dropped his purse: and we give the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_371" id="Page_371">[371]</a></span>
account of its restoration to its owner in his highness's own
words, in order to show the opinion his highness entertains
of the numerous fools who were civil enough to make "feasts
for him" while he was in this country.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>"Scarcely had I rested myself at table (at Avoca), when I was told
that some one wished to speak to me. A young man, whom I had
never seen, was shown in, and presented to me a pocket-book, which, to
my no small astonishment, I recognized as my own; containing,
besides other important papers which I always carry about me, all the
money I had taken for my journey. I had, Lord knows how, dropped
it out of my breast-pocket; and had, therefore, no small reason to congratulate
myself on so honourable and obliging a finder. In England
I should hardly have had the good fortune to see my pocket-book
again, even if a 'gentleman' had found it; he would probably have let
it lie in peace,&mdash;or kept it."</p></div>

<p>Whatever we might have been likely to do by his
pocket-book, we may, on this particular occasion, allow his
highness's tour-book to "<em>lie</em> in peace."&mdash;He proceeds to
exhibit his intimate knowledge of the "insular life:"&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>"A really poor man, who is not in a situation to contract debts,
can on no terms be a 'gentleman.' On the contrary, a rich scamp, who
has had what is called a good education, so long as he preserves his
'character' (reputation) dexterously, passes for a 'perfect gentleman.'
In the exclusive society of London there are yet finer 'nuances.' A
man, for instance, who were to manifest any timidity or courtesy
towards women, instead of treating them in a familiar and 'nonchalant'
manner, would awaken the suspicion that he was 'no gentleman;' but
should the luckless man ask twice for soup at dinner, or appear in
evening dress at a breakfast which begins at three in the afternoon and
ends at midnight, he may be a prince and a 'millionaire,' but he is 'no
gentleman.'"</p></div>

<p>Had his highness named none of his English (and Welsh)
associates, one might have found a charitable apology for
the above: as it is, we are bound to express our cordial
agreement with one of his observations&mdash;viz., that a man
"may be a prince" without being a gentleman. His highness
now threads the Dargle; a coarse attack, full of blasphemous
allusions, upon Lord Powerscourt, follows; and we<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_372" id="Page_372">[372]</a></span>
then are carried to Donnybrook fair. A description of the
bestialities of that festival is given, which concludes with an
account of a flirtation, to call it by the gentlest name, between
a pair of lovers "excessively drunk,"&mdash;the whole of which
is introduced merely to usher in this remark:&mdash;"My reverence
for truth compels me to add, that not the slightest trace of
English brutality was to be perceived." We hope the Lady
Janes and Lady Marys, who waltzed and gallopaded with
this "thoroughly illustrious" prince&mdash;their fathers, whose
wines he drank&mdash;and their brothers, whose horses he rode,&mdash;will
not forget this passage, in case his "noble and prepossessing
aspect" should again chance to enlighten our
"insular gloom."</p>

<p>Once more safe in his quarters at Dublin, our Prince lays
down as an axiom that "nobody eats soup in England."
"This," says his highness, "is the reason, by-the-bye, for
which my old Saxon left me; he declared that he could not
exist any longer in a state of barbarism&mdash;without soup."
Now, that his highness's "Saxon" should have quitted "his
ground" on this score seems odd,&mdash;inasmuch as his highness
himself has just before told us, that "the luckless
man who asked for soup twice at dinner" could be "no
gentleman;" in other words, that such is an usual mark
of what our superfine novelists call "vulgarity!" For the
rest, his highness appears to have lived much more in coffee-houses
than anywhere else; and, as everybody knows,
whole seas of soup&mdash;black, grey, red, and green&mdash;are daily
and hourly bubbling and smoking in all such quarters. Of
one of these same coffee-houses, after denying the existence
of soup, and explaining that the Irish boil their potatoes
"in water," his highness thus continues his description:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>"But now follows the second stage:&mdash;the table-cloth is removed;
clean plate, and knife and fork laid, wine and wine-glass, and a few
miserable apples or pears, with stony ship biscuits are brought: and
now the dinner seems to begin to enjoy tranquillity and comfort. His
countenance assumes an expression of satisfaction; apparently sunk in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_373" id="Page_373">[373]</a></span>
profound meditation, leaning back in his chair, and looking fixedly
straight before him, he suffers a sip of wine to glide down his throat from
time to time, only breaking the death-like silence by now and then
laboriously craunching his rocky biscuits.</p>

<p>"When the wine is finished, follows stage the third&mdash;that of digestion.
All motion now ceases; his appetite being satiated, he falls into
a sort of magnetic sleep, only distinguishable from the natural by the
open eyes. After this has lasted for half an hour or an hour, all at once
it ceases; he cries out, as if under the influence of some sudden possession,
'Waiter, my slippers;' and seizing a candle, walks off <ins class="corr" title="Transcriber's Note&mdash;Original text: 'gravely   his'">gravely to
his</ins> chamber to meet his slippers and repose."</p></div>

<p>It appears to us very odd that the gallant prince should
have, in this luculent sketch of "insular life," suppressed
all mention of his "attracted" friends the chambermaids.
He proceeds,&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>"Englishmen who do not belong to the aristocracy, and are not very
rich, usually travel without a servant by the mail or stage-coach, which
deposits them at the inn. The man who waits on strangers to the
coach, cleans their boots, etc., has the universal appellation of 'Boots.'
It is, accordingly, 'Boots' who brings your slippers, helps you to pull
off your boots, and then departs, first asking at what time you will have,
not, as in Germany, your coffee, but your hot water to shave. He
appears with it punctually at the appointed hour, and brings your
clothes cleanly brushed. The traveller then hastens to dress himself
and to return to his beloved coffee-room, where the ingredients of breakfast
are richly spread upon his table. To this meal he seems to bring
more animation than to any other, and indeed I think more appetite;
for the number of cups of tea, the masses of bread and butter, eggs and
cold meat, which he devours, awaken silent envy in the breast, or rather
in the stomach, of the less capable foreigner. He is now not only permitted,
but enjoined (by custom his gospel) to read. At every cup of
tea he unfolds a newspaper of the size of a table-cloth. Not a single
speech, crim. con., murder, or other catastrophe, invented by the 'accident
maker' in London, escapes him.</p>

<p>"Like one who would rather die of a surfeit than leave anything
uneaten which he had paid for, the systematic Englishman thinks that,
having called for a newspaper, he ought not to leave a letter of it unread.
By this means his breakfast lasts several hours, and the sixth or seventh
cup is drunk cold. I have seen this glorious meal protracted so long that
it blended with dinner; and you will hardly believe me when I assure
you, that a light supper followed at midnight without the company
quitting the table."&mdash;Pp. 209-212.</p></div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_374" id="Page_374">[374]</a></span></p>

<p>The correctness of this picture is striking; but we do not
exactly trace the sequence of thought within his highness's
illustrious breast which conducts him from this analysis of
coffee-house breakfasts, through a few more uncalled-for
insinuations of contempt for the individuals at whose houses
he had been visiting, to the grand reflection with which it
pleases him to close, p. 234, viz., "Nevertheless, the English
nobleman, even the least of the lords, in the bottom of his
heart, thinks himself a better man than the king of France."
This, written <span class="fs70">A.D.</span> 1828, appears to be gratuitous malice;
though, as to being a better man than the king of France, if
there be truth in Hennequin, we certainly hope there is
hardly an Englishman, whether great lord or little gentleman,
amongst us&mdash;liable as we are to the charge of stealing
pocket-books from living princes,&mdash;who would, in January,
1832, be ambitious to change characters with the actual
occupant of the Tuileries.</p>

<p>At page 218, this exemplary advocate of Popish emancipation
in Ireland, lets slip the following simple and natural
observations:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>"I returned to Dublin just at the moment of a meeting of the 'Catholic
Association,' and alighted at the door of their house: unfortunately,
however, neither Shiel nor O'Connell was present, so that there was no
great attraction. Heat and bad smells ('<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">car l'humanité Catholique pûe
autant qu'une autre</span>') drove me out in a few minutes.</p>

<p>"In the evening I was better amused by the performances of
some other charlatans&mdash;a company of English horse-riders who are
here."</p></div>

<p class="noindent">This is complimentary, and quite consistent with what will
be found in the sequel.</p>

<p>The prince now starts for the south of Ireland&mdash;visiting
and ridiculing a variety of families on his route. On one
particular household he is especially jocose, and instances, in
illustration of the state of their domestic information, a "long
and patient" search which was made "in a map of Europe,
for the United States!" (p. 221.) He adds,&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_375" id="Page_375">[375]</a></span></p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>"The occasion of the search was, that the old gentleman wanted to
show me Halifax and B&mdash;&mdash; town, which latter takes its name from
him."</p></div>

<p>For one moment we must beg leave to stop his highness;
no Englishman, or Irishman, ever talks of the United
States; we always speak of America; and as, unfortunately
for his highness, America is the distinctive appellation of
one quarter of the globe, no Englishman, or even Irishman,
would ever expect to find America in a map of Europe. If,
indeed, it had been a question about Puckler-Muskau, or any
such place, if place it be, we should, in common with all the
rest of the world, the prince himself perhaps excepted, have
hunted with the greatest alacrity to find it. But why was
this old "country squire" so anxious to find the two American
towns, which, by his anxiety, it is clear he thought his
illustrious visitor knew nothing about? Why? Why, because
he "laid the first stone of both during the American
war, in which he commanded seven hundred men, and loves
to recall those days of his youth and importance." In the
preceding page he tells us that his host "is seventy-two
years old, and hale and vigorous as a man of fifty." Now,
mark:&mdash;Halifax, the capital of the province of Nova Scotia,
was founded in May, 1749, being exactly seventy-nine years
before the year 1828, in which his highness had the good
fortune to meet with its "hale" founder, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">anno ætatis</i> seventy-two,
in Ireland, he having, according to his highness's
account and calculation, commanded seven hundred men,
and laid the first stone of a city, exactly seven years and
four months before he was born. Whether this "vigorous"
personage waited for the accouchement of his respectable
mother to begin operations at B&mdash;&mdash;, we cannot determine&mdash;the
initial (so delicate!) baffles us; but we ought to be
contented with his early exertions in the public service at
Halifax.</p>

<p>These innocent, or rather imbecile, blunders or fictions are
followed by another blasphemous satire upon our Church<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_376" id="Page_376">[376]</a></span>
service&mdash;coupled with the remark, that Ireland is "debased
by the stupid intolerance of the English priesthood," and that,
therefore, out of a party of twenty persons, nobody knew
where Carlsbad or Prague was; they did not even know
where Bohemia was; in short, "everything out of Great
Britain and Paris was a country in the moon." All this is at
Limerick,&mdash;where the sexton of one of the "Catholic
churches" told him they had rung the bells as soon as they
heard of his arrival, and begged ten shillings as a gratuity;
though we strongly suspect, that in 1828, the "Catholic
churches" had no bells; where his highness is offered the
order of the Liberators, which he declines, and compounds
for dining with the Agitators; and where also occurs that
scene of his being mistaken for young Ney, which we took
leave to transpose to the earlier part of our observations, in
order to identify the author.</p>

<p>The great object, however, of his highness's Irish excursion
was, as might have been anticipated, to visit Mr.
O'Connell; and accordingly he gets a horse (a friend's, of
course) to ride to Derrinane, by a route which man on
horseback never went before. On the journey a "soft rain
began to fall," and his delicate highness (who, be it remembered,
always prefers, or, at least, adopts the fashion of
"travelling outside") writes thus:&mdash;"As I am seldom in the
way of enjoying such a bath in the open air, I waded with a
great feeling of satisfaction and pleasure through the streams,
throwing myself in some degree into the pleasurable state of
mind of a duck. Nothing of that kind is, as you know,
impossible to my mobile fancy." What are we to make of
this? His "thorough-lustre," the Prince Puckler-Muskau&mdash;the
"dignified," "prepossessing," all-accomplished, admired of
Goethe, the frank and favoured correspondent of Julia, and
the personal friend of Lady Morgan,&mdash;to be able to throw
himself into the pleasurable state of mind of a duck! and
then appealing to his "beloved soul" to bear public testimony
that he is capable of such an exertion. But<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_377" id="Page_377">[377]</a></span>
perhaps the translator is in fault, and "duck" is not the
right word.</p>

<p>In his progress to Derrinane, a series of Munchausen adventures
await his highness:&mdash;he contrives to keep his seat
in the saddle six miles after having broken his saddle-girths&mdash;he
subsequently saddles himself, and leads his horse, (his
carriage and people not being there)&mdash;and at length, after
fording bottomless torrents, ascending inaccessible hills, and
avoiding various inevitable accidents, the least of which
would have been mortal, he reaches "the Abbey," and, after
much thumping and ringing, obtains admission. As many
of our readers may never have had the honour of inspecting
this distinguished <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">interieur</i>, we must let his highness speak:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>"The tower clock was striking eleven, and I was, I confess, somewhat
anxious as to my dinner, especially as I saw no living being, except
a man in a dressing-gown at an upper window. Soon, however, I heard
sounds in the house; a handsomely dressed servant appeared, bearing
silver candlesticks, and opened the door of a room, in which I saw with
astonishment a company of from fifteen to twenty persons sitting at a
long table, on which were placed wine and dessert. A tall, handsome
man, of cheerful and agreeable aspect, rose to receive me, and apologized
for having given me up in consequence of the lateness of the hour,
regretted that I had made such a journey in such terrible weather,
presented me in a cursory manner to his family, who formed the
majority of the company, and then conducted me to my bedroom.
This was the great O'Connell!</p>

<p>"On the whole, he exceeded my expectations. His exterior is
attractive; and the expression of intelligent good-nature, united with
determination and prudence, which marks his countenance, is extremely
winning. He has, perhaps, more of persuasiveness than of genuine,
large, and lofty eloquence; and one frequently perceives too much
design and manner in his words. Nevertheless, it is impossible not to
follow his powerful arguments with interest, to view the martial dignity
of his carriage without pleasure, or to refrain from laughing at his wit.
It is very certain that he looks much more like a general of Napoleon's
than a Dublin advocate. This resemblance is rendered much more
striking by the perfection with which he speaks French, having been
educated at the Jesuits' College at Doual and St. Omer. His family
is old, and was probably one of the great families of the land. His
friends, indeed, maintain that he springs from the ancient kings of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_378" id="Page_378">[378]</a></span>
Kerry,&mdash;an opinion which no doubt adds to the reverence with which
he is regarded by the people. He himself told me&mdash;and not without a
certain pretension&mdash;that one of his cousins was Comte O'Connell, and
'cordon rouge' in France; and another a baron, general and chamberlain
to the Emperor of Austria; but that he was the head of the family.
He is about fifty years old, and in excellent preservation, though his
youth was rather wild and riotous....</p>

<p>"If he should succeed in obtaining emancipation, of which I have no
doubt, his career, so far from being closed, will, I think, only then properly
begin. The evils of Ireland, and of the constitution of Great Britain
generally, lie too deep to be removed by emancipation. His understanding
is sharp and quick, and manners, as I have said, winning and
popular; although somewhat of the actor is perceivable in them, they
do not conceal his very high opinion of himself, and are occasionally
tinged by what an Englishman would call 'vulgarity.' Where is there
a picture entirely without a shade?</p>

<p>"Another interesting man, the real, though not ostensible, head of
the Catholics, was present, Father L'Estrange, a friar, and O'Connell's
confessor. He may be regarded as the real founder of that Catholic
Association so often derided in England, but which by merely negative
powers, by dexterous activity in secret, and by universally organizing
and training the people to one determinate end, attained a power over
them as boundless as that of the hierarchy in the middle ages; with
this difference, that the former strove for light and liberty, the latter
for darkness and slavery. This is another outbreak of that second great
revolution, which solely by intellectual means, without any admixture
of physical force, is advancing to its accomplishment; and whose simple
but resistless weapons are public discussion and the press. L'Estrange
is a man of philosophical mind and unalterable calmness. His manners
are those of an accomplished gentleman who has traversed Europe in
various capacities, has a thorough knowledge of mankind, and with all
his mildness cannot always conceal the sharp traces of great astuteness.
I should call him the ideal of a well-intentioned Jesuit. As O'Connell
was busy, I took an early walk with the friar to a desert island, to
which we crossed dry-footed over the smooth sand now left by the ebb.
Here stand the genuine ruins of Derrinane Abbey, to which O'Connell's
house is only an appendix. It is to be repaired by the family, probably
when some of their hopes are fulfilled....</p>

<p>"I wondered when I afterwards found both O'Connell and L'Estrange
entirely free from religious bigotry, and even remarked in them very
tolerant and philosophical views, though they persisted in choosing to
continue true Catholics. I wished I had been able to conjure hither
some of those furious imbeciles among the English Protestants, who<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_379" id="Page_379">[379]</a></span>
cry out at those Catholics as irrational and bigoted; while they themselves
alone, in the true sense of the word, cling to the fanatical faith
of their politico-religious party, and are firmly predetermined to keep
their long ears for ever closed to reason and humanity."&mdash;Vol. i.,
pp. 334-338.</p></div>

<p>Tearing himself from "the Man of the People," Father
L'Estrange, and the rest of "the court of Derrinane," our
prince transports himself to Killarney; inspects Mucruss,
rows about the lakes, repeats some of Mr. Crofton Croker's
stories of the great O'Donoghue, and again falls into one of
those <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">affaires du cœur</i>, his clever management of which has
so moved the admiration of the venerable Goethe.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>"The Irish naïveté of the innkeeper's daughter made such an agreeable
impression on me, that on my return to her father's inn I scarcely
talked to anybody else, and thus won her good graces. She had never
quitted her native mountains, and was as ignorant of the world as it is
possible to conceive. I asked her, in jest, if she would go with me to
Cork. 'Oh no,' said she, 'I should be afraid to go so far with you.
Do tell me now who you really are: You are a Jew&mdash;<em>that</em> I know
already.' 'Why, are you mad?' said I; 'what makes you think I must
be a Jew?' 'Ah, you can't deny it; haven't you a black beard all round
your chin, and five or six gold rings on your fingers?' My disclaimer
was of no use. At last, however, she said good-humouredly, that if I
positively would not allow that I was one, she wished at least that I
might 'become as rich as a Jew,' (an English phrase.) I confirmed this
with a Christian 'Amen!'"</p></div>

<p>Barring the last bit of blasphemy, this is a laughable page.
We only ask, whether any prince, who had not the mind
of a duck, would record such an adventure as this? Another
bar-maid&mdash;another pot-girl&mdash;and she to whom he exclusively
devoted his attentions, to set him down for a Jew, and not
to be convinced to the contrary! Where were his "people"&mdash;where
the evidence to counteract this calumny? The mere
nastiness of encouraging a tuft of unseemly hair under his
chin could hardly have led the girl to this conclusion.</p>

<p>The second volume presents us with a series of visits to
Protestant country gentlemen, whose manners and dinners<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_380" id="Page_380">[380]</a></span>
he derides, and whose wives and daughters are talked of as
"imbecile bigots," because they "remember the Sabbath-day,
and keep it holy,"&mdash;interspersed with scenes on which his
highness dwells with more satisfaction, but of which we
regret to find we can afford but few specimens. At Cashel
he passes several of his <em>white</em> days, chiefly, of course, in
the company of persons unconnected with the "stupid, dull,
Anglican system." <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Inter alia</i>, he is invited by "the Catholic
dean to meet the archbishop and sixteen other clergymen at
dinner."</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>"The table did honour to a chaplain of the Holy Father.... The
conversation then turned on religious subjects, and was in a perfectly
free and partial spirit: never did I perceive the least trace of bigotry,
or of the disgusting affectation of puritanical rigour. At the dessert,
several sang their national songs, some of which had no pretension to
sanctity. As the one who sat next me remarked some little surprise on
my countenance, he said in my ear, 'Here we forget the foreign * * * *
the archbishop, and the priest,&mdash;at table we are only gentlemen, and
to enjoy ourselves.'"&mdash;Vol. ii., pp. 47, 48.</p>

<p>"Before the archbishop retired," says his highness, "he said to me,
in a most obliging manner, 'You are <em>as you tell us!</em> a bishop! consequently,
you owe obedience to the archbishop. I employ this, my
authority, to command you to dine here to-morrow with your colleague
the Bishop of Limerick, whom we expect to-day;&mdash;I must hear of no
excuse.' I answered, taking up the jest, 'I readily confess that it does
not beseem me to withstand the discipline of the Church, and your
grace and the dean know so well how to sweeten obedience, that I
submit the more willingly.'"</p>

<p>"I passed the evening in the society of the * * * * I have seldom
found Protestant clergymen so frank and sincere as these Catholics.
We came to the conclusion, that we must either receive blindly the
hereditary faith the Church prescribes; or, if this be not in our power,
form our own religious system as the result of individual thoughts and
individual feelings, which may rightly be called the religion of philosophers.
The * * * * spoke French most fluently, I therefore quote his own
words: '<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Heureusement on peut en quelque sorte combiner l'un et
l'autre; car, au bout du compte, il faut une religion positive au peuple.'
'Et dites surtout,</span>' replied I, '<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">qu'il en faut une aux rois et aux prêtres;
car aux uns elle fournit le par la grâce de Dieu, et aux autres, de la
puissance, des honneurs, et des richesses; le <em>peuple</em> se contenterait,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_381" id="Page_381">[381]</a></span>
peut-être, de bonnes lois et d'un gouvernement libre.</span>' 'Ah,' interrupted
he, 'you think like Voltaire,</p></div>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza" lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">
<p class="verseq">"Les prêtres ne sont pas ce qu'un vain peuple pense,</p>
<p class="verse">Et sa crédulité fait toute notre science."'</p>
</div></div></div>

<div class="blockquot">

<p class="noindent">'<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Ma foi,</span>' said I, '<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">si tous les prêtres vous ressemblaient je penserais
bien autrement.</span>'"</p>

<p>"I was, unfortunately, unable to keep my word with my friendly
Amphitryon. A 'megrim' confined me all day to my bed. The archbishop
sent me word that he would cure me; and, if I would but bring
firm faith, would be sure to drive away the headache-fiend by a well-applied
exorcism. I was, however, obliged to reply, that this devil was
not one of the most tractable, and that he respected no one but Nature,
who sends and recalls him at her pleasure, which, alas! is seldom in
less than four-and-twenty hours. I must, therefore, cut off even you,
dearest Julia, with a few words."</p></div>

<p>This is a pleasant specimen of communication between a
"frank and sincere" Irish * * * *, and a Lutheran liberal,
who, in order to quiz the very idea of a Protestant episcopacy,
announces himself at a drinking, singing party of
papists, of which an archbishop makes one, to be a bishop
himself.</p>

<p>When the prince has done with the popish archbishop, he
takes to the pipers, and is safely delivered of this sapient
remark:&mdash;"These pipers, who are almost all blind, derive
their origin from remote antiquity. They are gradually
fading away, for all that is old must vanish from the earth."
This is a truism:&mdash;but, as pipers, like other men, to whatever
age they may attain, are all born young&mdash;even in
Ireland&mdash;his highness may still encourage the hope, that
when the old ones die off, others will succeed them. The
chapter of pipers is succeeded by a not very delicate one
on game-cocks; but we must pass over this, and accompany
the prince to the Phœnix Park, where he is in his proper
sphere.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>"Lord Anglesea invited me to dinner," says his highness, "and the
party was brilliant. He is beloved in Ireland for his impartiality, and
for the favour he has always shown to the cause of emancipation. His<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_382" id="Page_382">[382]</a></span>
exploits as a general officer are well known&mdash;no man has a more graceful
and polished address in society. A more perfect work of art than
his false leg I never saw."</p></div>

<p>This climax of compliment will, no doubt, be felt and
appreciated by his Excellency: he adds&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>"The power and dignity of a Lord Lieutenant are considerable as
representative of the king; but he holds them only at the pleasure of
the ministry. Among other privileges, he has that of creating Baronets;
and in former times inn-keepers, and men even less qualified, have
received that dignity."</p></div>

<p>Baronets, as everybody knows, the Lord Lieutenant never
could create, and the knighthoods the prince refers to most
ungracefully, considering the "free and easy" manner in
which, as we shall presently see, he treated Sir Charles
Morgan and Sir Arthur Clarke&mdash;the individuals to whom he
obviously points&mdash;and their "womankind." But, indeed,
his malignity towards unfortunate Lady Morgan is worthy
of severer reprehension. The following passage appears to
us entirely indefensible:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>"I spent a very pleasant evening to-day at Lady M&mdash;&mdash;'s. The
company was small, but amusing, and enlivened by the presence of two
very pretty friends of our hostess, who sang in the best Italian style.
I talked a great deal with Lady M&mdash;&mdash; on various subjects, and she has
talent and feeling enough always to excite a lively interest in her conversation.
On the whole, I think I did not say enough in her favour
in my former letter; at any rate, I did not then know one of her most
charming qualities,&mdash;that of possessing two such pretty relatives.</p>

<p>"The conversation fell upon her works, and she asked me how I
liked her Salvator Rosa? 'I have not read it,' replied I, 'because' (I
added by way of excusing myself, '<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">tant bien que mal</span>') 'I like your
fictions so much, that I did not choose to read anything historical from
the pen of the most imaginative of romance writers.' 'O, that is only
a romance,' said she; 'you may read it without any qualms of conscience.'
'Very well,' thought I; 'probably that will apply to your
travels too,'&mdash;but this I kept to myself. 'Ah,' said she, 'believe me, it
is only <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">ennui</i> that sets my pen in motion; our destiny in this world is
such a wretched one that I try to forget it in writing.' Probably the
Lord Lieutenant had not invited her, or some other great personage had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_383" id="Page_383">[383]</a></span>
failed in 'his engagement to her, for she was quite out of spirits."&mdash;Vol.
ii., p. 103.</p></div>

<p>At page 108 we are introduced to Lady Clarke, Lady
Morgan's sister&mdash;for they are both "Ladies"&mdash;and Sir Arthur
Clarke, and the Misses Clarke, who turn out to be the two
"pretty relatives." Lady Clarke, we are told, "is very
superior to her celebrated relation in accurate taste and
judgment." Of the young ladies, whom his highness calls his
"little nightingales," the prince says much; but it would be
unfair to criticise his criticisms upon them, which are only
distinguished by vanity, puppyism, conceit, bad taste, and
bad feeling. He takes these poor girls to see "the fine
artist," M. Ducrow, ("an admirable model for sculptors, in
an elastic dress, which fits exquisitely,") ride nine horses at
once, and "finally go to bed with a pony dressed as an old
woman;" and the "little one" trembled with delight, with
anxiety and eagerness, and kept her hands clenched all the
time; and then comes a history of his fetching out a girl,
who had acted Napoleon, from a dressing-room, where she
stood naked as "a little Cupid before the glass," (we should
have said a little Venus!)&mdash;but there is no end to his
malice.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>"I rested myself (he says) this evening in the accustomed place.
'Tableaux' were again the order of the day. I had to appear successively
as Brutus, an Asiatic Jew, Francis the First, and Saladin. Miss
J&mdash;&mdash; was a captivating little fellow as a student of Alcala; and her
eldest sister, as a fair slave, a welcome companion to Saladin. As the
beautiful Rebecca, she also assorted not ill with the oriental Jew. All
these metamorphoses were accomplished with the help only of four
candles, two looking-glasses, a few shawls and coloured handkerchiefs, a
burnt cork, a pot of rouge, and different heads of hair."</p></div>

<p class="noindent">Even the mysteries of her ladyship's dressing-room, and the
articles which compose her ladyship's toilette, are not sacred
in the eyes of this "right-minded observer!"</p>

<p>Our readers have probably had enough of the prince.
On the political portion of his highness's book we cannot<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_384" id="Page_384">[384]</a></span>
enter, because his politics are universally mixed up with
impiety. As to personal adventure, his closing chapters on
Ireland contain little of that, except his being invited to
drink wine at a radical meeting, and a visit to the Catholic
Association. The rest is a mere tissue of commonplaces,
evidently gleaned from the female attendants of the small
inns which his highness was in the habit of frequenting,
while his "carriage and people" were absent. He quits
Ireland, and starts from Holyhead by the mail; he arrives
at Shrewsbury, and, although the mail very rarely stops for
anybody, perambulates the whole town,&mdash;sketches the
horses,&mdash;examines the castle, and the tread-mill,&mdash;and yet
is in time to pursue his journey, which he does on the
outside of the mail, with four outside passengers! At Monmouth
he pauses,&mdash;goes into a bookseller's shop to "buy a
Guide,"&mdash;and "unexpectedly" makes the acquaintance of the
bookseller's "very amiable family," particularly two "pretty
daughters,"&mdash;of whom his highness observes, as a Lyell or
Murchison would of lumps of nickel or tungsten, "they were
the most perfect specimens of innocent country girls I ever
met with." They were at tea when his highness dropped
in; and the father, "unusually loquacious for an Englishman,
took him absolutely and formally prisoner, and began
to ask him the strangest questions about the Continent and
about politics."</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>"The daughters," said his highness, "obviously pitied me&mdash;probably
from experience&mdash;and tried to restrain him; but I let him go on, and
surrendered myself for half an hour <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">de bonne grace</i>, by which I won the
good-will of the whole family to such a degree, that they all pressed me
most warmly to stay some days in this beautiful country, and to take
up my abode with them. When I rose at length to go, they positively
refused to take anything for the book; '<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">bongré, malgré</i>,' I was forced
to keep it as a present. Such conquests please me; because their manifestations
can come only from the heart."</p></div>

<p>The reader will presently find the sequel to this double
shot, by which two perfect specimens of innocence were
killed dead; but he must first be told that his highness,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_385" id="Page_385">[385]</a></span>
the next morning, charges the landlord of his inn, the waiters,
or the chambermaids, or somebody, with stealing his purse
and pocket-book. They indignantly deny the charge, and
repel the imputation, which his highness appears to have
been anxious to cast equally upon gentlemen and innkeepers,
and offer to submit to instant search, adding, however, that
his highness must undergo a similar operation. This his
highness declines; he thinks it best to put up with the
loss of ten pounds, and depart; and what will the reader
think he therefore did? "Why," says the prince, "I therefore
took some more bank-notes out of my travelling-bag, paid
the reckoning, and so departed."</p>

<p>From this splendid detail we discern that his highness
travelled with a <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">sac de nuit</span> stuffed with bank-notes; nevertheless&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<p class="verse">"The Prince, unable to conceal his pain"</p>
</div></div></div>

<p class="noindent">at the loss of his ten pounds, runs to his amiable friends at
the bookshop, and imparts to them the disaster:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>"The surprise and concern of all were equal. In a few minutes the
daughters began to whisper to their mother, made signs to one another,
then took their father on one side; and after a short deliberation, the
youngest came up to me and asked me, blushing and embarrassed,
'Whether this loss might not have caused me a temporary embarrassment,
and whether I would accept a loan of five pounds, which I could
restore whenever I returned that way:' at the same time trying to push
the note into my hand. Such genuine kindness touched me to the
heart: it had something so affectionate and disinterested, that the
greatest benefit conferred under other circumstances would perhaps
have inspired me with less gratitude than this mark of unaffected goodwill.
You may imagine how cordially I thanked them. 'Certainly,'
said I, 'were I in the slightest difficulty, I should not be too proud to
accept so kind an offer; but as this is not in the least degree the case, I
shall lay claim to your generosity in another way, and beg permission to
be allowed to carry back to the Continent a kiss from each of the fair
girls of Monmouth.' This was granted, amid much laughter and good-natured
resignation. Thus freighted, I went back to my carriage!"&mdash;(N.B.&mdash;He
had come by the mail.)</p></div>

<p>The end of all this interesting story is, that two or three<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_386" id="Page_386">[386]</a></span>
days after, his highness (whom, like Goethe, and unlike the
barmaids, and the bookseller's daughters, we always "figure
to ourselves as of a dignified aspect") finds his purse and his
book in his dressing-gown pocket, so that the whole episode
is given to show his Julia what a fine man he is, and how
ready his "specimens of innocence" are to fall vanquished at
his feet.&mdash;"Eich dyn!"</p>

<p>But we must cut his highness short. At Bristol he enters
Radcliffe Church while the organ is playing, and stations
himself in a corner, whence he could catch a glimpse at the
interior:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>"The illiberality of the English Church would not allow me this
satisfaction, and the preacher sent an old woman to tell me that I must
sit down. As it is not the custom in Catholic churches to interrupt the
devotions of a congregation on such light grounds, even if strangers go
in without any caution to view whatever is worth seeing in the church,
I might justly wonder that English Protestant piety should have so
little confidence in its own strength, as to be thus blown about by the
slightest breath. The riddle was explained to me afterwards: I should
have to pay for my seat, and the truly pious motive was the sixpence.
However, I had had enough, and left their mummery without paying."</p></div>

<p>The substantial veracity of this narrative who can doubt?
but that no preacher at Radcliffe Church ever took the
slightest notice of his highness we will venture to affirm;
the pew-opener might have thought that such a fine man as
his highness would like to sit down, or the beadle might
have thought it civil to an Israelite&mdash;for which he seems to
have generally been mistaken&mdash;to show him a little Christian
charity.</p>

<p>Passing over his highness's account of Bath, and Mr.
Beckford, "a sort of Lord Byron in prose, who pays fifty
guineas a week for leave to walk in a nursery garden and
pick what flowers he chooses;"&mdash;of Salisbury, where the
prince meets another specimen&mdash;"a very pretty young girl,"
a dress-maker,&mdash;and of course takes an opportunity of libelling
the bishop, the venerable and excellent Dr. Burgess,&mdash;who<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_387" id="Page_387">[387]</a></span>
"never preaches, and draws 15,000<em>l.</em> a-year from his
see!"&mdash;of Wilton, to which house he obtains admission by
a story, and under an assumed name, which he rejoices to
hear the housekeeper could neither pronounce nor write;&mdash;and
some other seats and towns,&mdash;we reach London,&mdash;his
highness's description of which is to occupy the two first,
but as yet unpublished, volumes of this work. When he
has sufficiently reinspected the "grand foyer," he again
mounts the box for Canterbury, criticises the cathedral, the
peculiar beauty of which he considers to arise from its not
having a screen! and satirizes the archbishop, who enjoys
"the rank of a prince" within his jurisdiction, "but not in
London,"&mdash;as if London were not in the heart of his Grace's
jurisdiction,&mdash;"moreover, he has sixty thousand a-year!
and may marry!" (in the teeth, we presume, of the statute
against bigamy.) The "illustrious stranger" proceeds to
Dover&mdash;thence to Calais&mdash;dines with, and of course abuses,
Mr. Brummel,&mdash;having, by-the-bye, gained admission to his
table, as he had done to Lord Pembroke's gallery, under a
feigned name! The "thorough lustre" of his principality is
then enshrined in the cabriolet of a diligence; he eats
smoking hot plinzen with the coachman, and arrives in
Paris, where for the present we shall leave him,&mdash;and that
"sweltering venom" which is luckily neutralized by an unfailing
effusion of dulness.</p>

<p>We are sorry that the first Prussian castigator of our manners
should have been a prince! We had, at one time, been led
to expect the notice of a personage, who, though of not quite
princely rank, could have told a much more amusing story,&mdash;described
"specimens" of a higher order than bar-maids&mdash;pecuniary
incidents more important than the loss of a ten-pound
note out of a sac-de-nuit,&mdash;and even wound up his
"picture of insular existence" with an interesting appendix
to the "<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Mémoires d'un Homme d'Etat</span>."</p>

<h3>PROSPECTUS FOR A GENERAL BURYING COMPANY.</h3>

<p class="center smcap">Capital, £500,000. Shares, £50.</p>

<p>The immediate object of this institution is to rob death
of its terrors, and, by following the example of our Parisian
friends, blend the graceful with the grave, and mingle the
picturesque with the pathetic:&mdash;in short, the directors feel
confident, that when their scheme is fully developed, the
whole system of inhumation will be changed, and the feelings
and associations connected with interments in general,
assume so novel a character, that it will be rather pleasant
than otherwise to follow our friends and relations to the
tomb.</p>

<p>It is proposed to purchase an extensive domain in the
neighbourhood of Primrose Hill and Caen Wood, where
the diversified undulations of ground, and the soothing
commixture of trees and water, afford the most flattering
promise of success in the undertaking. No difficulty is
anticipated in the purchase of the property, since the will
of the late noble owner distinctly points out that it shall
remain "grass land" to all eternity; and, "since all flesh
is grass," no reasonable objection can be raised to its appropriation
as a public cemetery.</p>

<p>The public cemetery, like the <cite>Daily Advertiser</cite>, will
be open to all parties&mdash;dead or alive, of all religions, or,
indeed, of none; and it does not need the practical knowledge
attainable by a visit to the French metropolis to
convince the world that by laying out the ground in a parklike
manner, with umbrageous walks, alcoves, bowers, and
fish-ponds, a link will be created between the past and
present generation, and the horrid idea of having deposited
a parent, a husband, or a sister, in a cold, damp grave,
or a gloomy vault, refined into the agreeable recollection
that they repose in a picturesque garden or a shady grove,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_389" id="Page_389">[389]</a></span>
at an easy distance from the most fashionable part of the
town.</p>

<p>The directors intend opening a convenient hotel and tavern
on the spot, at which persons visiting the cemetery, either
as mourners or in search of quiet retreats for themselves,
may procure every sort of refreshment. A <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">table-d'hôte</i> will
be constantly prepared at five shillings a-head, for which
cold meat and <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">vin de grave</i> will be furnished; and on
Tuesdays, Thursdays, and Saturdays, during the summer,
after burying-hours, Collinet's band will be regularly engaged
for quadrilles, and the grounds illuminated with variegated
lamps.</p>

<p>A committee of taste will be appointed to regulate the
designs of tombs; and the directors think it may save
trouble to state in the outset that no allusions to death,
nor any representations of skulls, cross-bones, skeletons,
or other disagreeable objects, will be permitted. The Royal
Society of Literature will be solicited to revise the inscriptions,
epitaphs, and elegies, and twelve ladies belonging to
the different <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">corps-de-ballet</i> of the King's Theatre, and the
Theatres Royal Covent Garden and Drury Lane, are engaged
to enliven the ground as mourners at newly-erected tombs.</p>

<p>These young ladies may be engaged by the day or hour,
at a moderate price, and find their own garlands.</p>

<p>Mr. Samuel Rogers is appointed master of the ceremonies,
and will appear dressed in the uniform of the establishment.</p>

<p>The directors have appointed Mr. Botibol, of Soho-square,
their artificial florist, who will provide all sorts of flowers
for strewing graves; but ladies and gentlemen are requested
not to leave the decorations on the tombs at night, but to
return them to the directress at the bar of the tavern: and,

<p class="p2" />
<p><span class="smcap">Postscript.</span>&mdash;The prospectus says that "an eligible site
having offered itself"&mdash;this must have been a very curious
site indeed&mdash;the temptation is too great to be resisted, and
the public are invited to unite in a joint stock, "Capital
£200,000, in shares of £25 each," to contrive something
more agreeable for our resting-places than mere vaults and
churchyards, and prepare a retreat, after the fashion of the
cemetery of <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Père la Chaise</i>, in the neighbourhood of that
ever gay and lively city&mdash;Paris.</p>

<p>"Within this area," continues the prospectus, "public
bodies and individuals may obtain ground for interment, and
liberty to erect mausoleums and monuments after their own
designs; and vaults and catacombs will also be constructed
for general use."</p>

<p>This is giving great latitude&mdash;mausoleums and monuments
erected promiscuously, after the designs of their future inhabitants,
will no doubt present a beautiful variety of tastes
and elevations. It should seem, however, that the vaults
and catacombs are not to be used exclusively for burying,
for, in contradistinction to the interments to which the
mausoleums and monuments are to be appropriated, the
prospectus states that the vaults and catacombs are for
general use. <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Déjeuners à la fourchette</i>, or <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">petits soupers</i> by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_391" id="Page_391">[391]</a></span>
moonlight, perhaps. We say by moonlight, because illuminating
the gardens in the evening does not yet appear
to form part of the design.</p>

<p>The following condition we have no doubt will be highly
advantageous in a pecuniary point of view to the proprietary,
but it sounds disagreeable:&mdash;</p>

<p>"Subscribers on or before the 30th day of June, 1830,
will be entitled to tickets of precedence, after the rate of
one ticket for every five shares; which ticket will entitle
the holder to a preference, according to the numerical order
of the shares, in the choice of a situation for a grave or a
monument. These tickets to be transferable without the
shares upon which they shall have been granted, and capable
of being held by persons who may not be subscribers or
proprietors."</p>

<p>Now, however seriously captious sticklers for rank and
pre-eminence may regard the article of precedence, we must
say that the case of going out of the world differs a good
deal from that of going out of a drawing-room; and we
suspect, if the committee of this deadly-lively society could
contrive to invert the order of departure, they would dispose
of a much greater number of shares than are likely to go
off under "existing circumstances." To the pleasure of
walking about a burying-ground, with a plan in one's hand,
like the Opera House box-book, to select a good place, we
confess ourselves somewhat insensible; but we have no
doubt that if this job takes, in less than five years we shall
see "Graves in a good situation to let," posted at Sams'
and Ebers', and "a transferable admission to a catacomb,"
to be sold for the season, just as a ticket for the pit is at
present.</p>

<h3>LETTER FROM JOHN TROT TO JOHN BULL.</h3>

<p><span class="smcap">Sir</span>,&mdash;I feel great diffidence in addressing you, and should
hesitate a long time before I ventured to throw myself upon
your consideration, and through you upon that of the public;
but the state of my case is desperate, and since it has recently
been decided that beggary is a crime, and that those
who dare to relieve distress with their own money are
punishable by law, I prefer at once appealing to you.</p>

<p>The fact is, sir, that I am a superannuated lady's footman,
my present situation is unbearable&mdash;I began the world in
the service of the Margravine of Anspach, and was then
accounted&mdash;I say it with all possible modesty&mdash;a remarkably
fine young man. Her highness never admitted <em>low</em> persons
(I mean in stature) to the honour of her livery; and many a
time, until the present Sir Lumley Skeffington chose a cream-coloured
coach for her highness instead of a yellow, have I,
under favour of the foreign scarlet, been taken for one of the
<em>élite</em> of Carlton House.</p>

<p>The Margravine went away, and I became the hanger-on
of a duchess's carriage, who shall be nameless, since she is
no more. The black breeches and gold bands did not quite
suit my taste, and I rejoice to find that they are now <em>out</em> to
all intents and purposes. However, speaking figuratively, as
well as literally, I hung on until her grace dropped off, then
<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">me voilà</i>! I had an offer from the Lord Mayor's household.
The livery was handsome, and one changes one's master
there, like an almanack, every year; but the Lord Mayors
have an unpleasant smell about them, and they go to the
Old Bailey and the Blue-coat School, and all those horrible
places, where one might catch unpleasant disorders, so I
declined, and made a push for Pall Mall&mdash;but it would not
do.</p>

<p>I then, sir, thought of Mr. Coutts,&mdash;the late very respect<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_393" id="Page_393">[393]</a></span>able
banker,&mdash;but just as I expected a character from the
late Mr. Raymond, of Drury-lane Theatre, he was taken ill
and died, and when I was about to renew my negotiations, a
melancholy circumstance occurred which determined me not
to engage in a place where I might, perhaps, be kicked out
at a moment's warning.</p>

<p>There <em>was</em> a house, which shall be nameless, in Surrey,
where an opening presented itself, but tallow-candles were
whispered to me, and I fell back. I had at that time a fancy
for Sir H&mdash;&mdash; W&mdash;&mdash; W&mdash;&mdash;'s service, for I thought the sugar-loaf
buttons were becoming; but the story about the sister and
the annuity disgusted me, and I cut that. So I went on,
sipping and smelling and never coming to the point, like
Macheath, in the operative mendicant's opera; for I was
made for a lady's footman, and I will even now back myself
against any other two yards and an eighth of humanity
behind a carriage, or at candle-light in that capacity. However,
to my distress.</p>

<p>I embarked in the service of a <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">nouveau riche</i> (not Hayne,
upon my honour), one of the mushrooms who blazed for a
season, and then not only went out, but went off, <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">me voilà!!</i>
again I looked round me. I was then nearly fifty, called
myself young, bought Tyrian dye, which turned my hair
blue, and rubbed the bald place on the crown of my head
with Russia oil, which smelt unpleasantly. Still no place;
the ladies all voted me too old, too fat, too this thing and too
that thing, until at last, dear Mr. Bull, I got a situation in a
place where I daresay you have never been, but which I
know you have heard of, called Montagu-place, Bedford-square,
next door but one to your excellent friend, Mrs.
Ramsbottom.</p>

<p>And now hear me. In this dreadful solitude, all one sees
is the new painted house of Old Cavendish (what a place for
a Cavendish!) at the corner a mews, where a man lets glass-coaches
(I heard Mr. Raikes make a joke at my master's about
a singer in a glass-coach, he called him <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Veluti in Speculum</i>;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_394" id="Page_394">[394]</a></span>
Mr. Raikes dines with us on off days, and always makes this
joke everywhere), and a gothic window out of a modern
house in Russell-square. Well, sir, in this infernal place I
am obliged to be up every morning before nine (the butler
has been in the family twenty years, wears cotton stockings,
and never washes his feet); they allow no eggs, only cold
meat for breakfast; there is no regular housekeeper; my
mistress's own maid is a dowdy, with fingers like radishes
unwashed, with squat nails, not nice; the two housemaids
absolute gorgons, and the coachman, who is admitted to the
privilege of <em>our</em> servants' hall, a dreadful person, smelling of
the stable worse even than Mrs. Hopkins' batch. <em>Oh, Giovi
Omnipotente!</em> as the Dutch say, what am I to do?</p>

<p>A particularly ill-done dinner is put down about one;
sometimes coarse shoulders of mutton (a joint for which my
cousin John left the service of a noble lord in the Cabinet
some years since), or cold meat, or hashes, or perhaps that
workhouse turbot, a brill, or some skate, with very secondary
butter for sauce. However, this I could bear; but the
carriage, built by some man nobody ever heard of, is called
to the door, the steps are so hard and stiff there is hardly
any pulling them down; my mistress having thick legs and
no daughters, makes things worse, and after having rammed
and jammed an infernal brass fist with a stick in it, which
my master considers elegant, by way of handle to his coach,
till I get it fast, up I mount and away we go, and anybody
may see my calves in cotton (no silk in the morning) shaking
like elongated moulds of blancmange all the way we rattle
along,&mdash;all the fault of the builder, no Leader, no Goddal,
Baxter and Macklew, no Houlditch, but some goth in Whitechapel.
This I could bear; but will you believe it, sir? my
master drinks port wine at and after dinner, and enforces my
attendance in the room&mdash;what can I do?&mdash;no claret, no
flirtations, no look-out, sniffing the drift air of St. Giles's,
and seeing nothing but hackney-coaches. I cannot give up
the place, although I don't get more than a half-pay lieutenant<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_395" id="Page_395">[395]</a></span>
in the navy after all; but I am an oppressed man, I feel myself
injured, and am, I confess, discontented: if you would
take me in hand, and recommend me to some person of taste
and judgment, I would go for half the money; but till I am
sure of another berth, I should be foolish to risk the bird in
hand. Will you say one word in your correspondence, or
put in my letter altogether? It may excite inquiry and
compassion, and if anybody wishes to communicate with me,
any of the Highgate or Kentish Town stages will bring the
letter; for, upon my word, I hardly know whether this district
is within the range of the regular twopenny post.</p>

<p class="right padr4">I am, Sir, yours in affliction,</p>
<p class="right smcap">John Trot.</p>

<h3>THE MARCH OF INTELLECT.</h3>

<p>It happened on the 31st of March, 1926, that the then
Duke and Duchess of Bedford were sitting in their good but
old house, No. 17, Liberality-place (the corner of Riego-street),
near to where old Hammersmith stood before the
great improvements, and, although it was past two o'clock,
the breakfast equipage still remained upon the table.</p>

<p>It may be necessary to state that the illustrious family in
question, having embraced the Roman Catholic faith (which
at that period was the established religion of the country),
had been allowed to retain their titles and honourable distinctions,
although Woburn Abbey had been long before
restored to the Church, and was, at the time of which we
treat, occupied by a worshipful community of holy friars.
The duke's family estates in Old London had been, of course,
divided by the Equitable Convention amongst the numerous
persons whose distressed situation gave them the strongest
claims, and his grace and his family had been for a long<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_396" id="Page_396">[396]</a></span>
time receiving the compensation annuity allotted to his
ancestors.</p>

<p>"Where is Lady Elizabeth?" said his grace to the
duchess.</p>

<p>"She is making the beds, duke," replied her grace.</p>

<p>"What, again to-day?" said his grace. "Where are
Stubbs, Hogsflesh, and Figgins, the females whom, were it
not contrary to law, I should call the housemaids?"</p>

<p>"They are gone," said her grace, "on a sketching tour
with the manciple, Mr. Nicholson, and his nephew."</p>

<p>"Why are not these things removed?" said his grace,
eyeing the breakfast-table, upon which (the piece of furniture
being of oak without covering) stood a huge jar of honey,
several saucers of beet-root, a large pot of half cold decoction
of sassafrage, and an urn full of bean-juice, the use of cotton,
sugar, tea, and coffee, having been utterly abolished by law
in the year 1888.</p>

<p>"I have rung several times," said the duchess, "and
sent Lady Maria up-stairs into the assistants' drawing-room
to get some of them to remove the things, but they have
kept her, I believe, to sing to them; I know they are very
fond of hearing her, and often do so."</p>

<p>His grace, whose appetite seemed renewed by the sight
of the still lingering viands which graced the board, seemed
determined to make the best of a bad bargain, and sat down
to commence an attack upon some potted seal and pickled
fish from Baffin's Bay and Behring's Straits, which some of
their friends who had gone over there to pass the summer
(as was the fashion of those times) in the East India steamships
(which always touched there) had given them; and
having consumed a pretty fair portion of the remnants,
his favourite daughter, Lady Maria, made her appearance.</p>

<p>"Well, Maria," said his grace, "where have you been
all this time?"</p>

<p>"Mr. Curry," said her ladyship, "the young person who<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_397" id="Page_397">[397]</a></span>
is good enough to look after our horses, had a dispute with
the lady who assists Mr. Biggs in dressing the dinner for
us, whether it was necessary at chess to say check to the
queen when the queen was in danger or not. I was unable
to decide the question, and I assure you I got so terribly
laughed at, that I ran away as fast as I could."</p>

<p>"Was Duggins in the assistants' drawing-room, my love?"
said the duke.</p>

<p>"No," said Lady Maria.</p>

<p>"I wanted him to take a message for me," said his grace,
in a sort of demi-soliloquy.</p>

<p>"I'm sure he cannot go, then," said Lady Maria, "because
I know he is gone to the House of Parliament (there was but
one at that time), for he told the other gentleman who cleans
the plate, that he could not be back to attend at dinner,
however consonant with his wishes, because he had promised
to wait for the division."</p>

<p>"Ah," sighed the duke, "this comes of his having been
elected for Westminster."</p>

<p>At this moment Lord William Cobbett Russell made his
appearance, extremely hot and evidently tired, having under
his arm a largish parcel.</p>

<p>"What have you there, Willy?" said her grace.</p>

<p>"My new breeches," said his lordship;&mdash;"I have called
upon the worthy citizen who made them, over and over
again, and never could get them, for of course I could not
expect him to send them, and he is always either at the
academy or the gymnasium: however, to-day I caught him
just as he was in a hot debate with a gentleman who was
cleaning his windows, as to whether the solidity of a prism
is equal to the product of its base by its altitude. I confess
I was pleased to catch him at home; but unluckily the
question was referred to me, and not comprehending it, I
was deucedly glad to get off, which I did as fast as I could,
both parties calling after me&mdash;'There is a lord for you&mdash;look
at my lord!'&mdash;and hooting me in a manner which,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_398" id="Page_398">[398]</a></span>
however constitutional, I cannot help thinking deucedly
disagreeable."</p>

<p>At this period, what in former times was called a footman,
named Dowbiggin, made his appearance, who entered the
room, as the duke hoped, to remove the breakfast-things&mdash;but
it was, in fact, to ask Lady Maria to sketch in a tree in
a landscape, which he was in the course of painting.</p>

<p>"Dowbiggin," said his grace in despair, "I wish you
would take away these breakfast-things."</p>

<p>"Indeed!" said Dowbiggin, looking at the duke with
the most ineffable contempt&mdash;"you do&mdash;that's capital&mdash;what
right have you to ask me to do any such thing?"</p>

<p>"Why, Mr. Dowbiggin," said the duchess, who was a
bit of a tartar in her way&mdash;"his grace pays you, and feeds
you, and clothes you, to&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Well, duchess," said Dowbiggin, "and what then?
Let his grace show me his superiority. I am ready to do
anything for him&mdash;but please to recollect I asked him
yesterday, when I <em>did</em> remove the coffee, to tell me what
the Altaic chain is called, when, after having united all
the rivers which supply the Jenisei, it stretches as far as
the Baikal lake&mdash;and what did he answer? he made a
French pun, and said '<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Je ne sais pas, Dobiggin</i>'&mdash;now, if
it can be shown by any statute that I, who am perfectly
competent to answer any question I propose, am first to
be put off with a quibble by way of reply; and secondly,
to be required to work for a man who does not know as much
as I do myself, merely because he is a duke, why, I'll do
it; but if not, I will resist in a constitutional manner such
illiberal oppression, and such ridiculous control, even though
I am transported to Scotland for it. Now, Lady Maria, go
on with the tree."</p>

<p>"Willy," said the duke to his son, "when you have
put away your small-clothes, go and ask Mr. Martingale
if he will be kind enough to let the horses be put to our
carriage, since the duchess and I wish to go to mass."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_399" id="Page_399">[399]</a></span></p>

<p>"You need not send to Martingale," said Dowbiggin;
"he is gone to the Society of Arts to hear a lecture on
astronomy."</p>

<p>"Then, Willy, go and endeavour to harness the horses
yourself," said the duke to his son, who instantly obeyed.</p>

<p>"You had better mind about those horses, sir," said
Dowbiggin, still watching the progress of his tree; "the
two German philosophers and Father O'Flynn have been
with them to-day, and there appears little doubt that the
great system will spread, and that even these animals which
we have been taught to despise, will express their sentiments
before long."</p>

<p>"The sentiments of a coach-horse!" sighed the duchess.</p>

<p>"Thanks, Lady Maria," said Dowbiggin; "now I'll go
to work merrily; and, duke, whenever you can fudge up
an answer to my question about the Altaic chain, send one
of the girls, and I'll take away the things."</p>

<p>Dowbiggin disappeared, and the duke, who was anxious
to get the parlour cleared (for the house, except two rooms,
was all appropriated to the assistants), resolved to inquire
of his priest, when he was out, what the proper answer
would be to Dowbiggin's question, which he had tried to
evade by the offensive quibble, when Lord William Cobbett
Russell re-appeared, as white as a sheet.</p>

<p>"My dear father," cried his lordship, "it's all over now.
The philosophers have carried the thing too far; the chestnut
mare swears she'll be d&mdash;d if she goes out to-day."</p>

<p>"What," said the duke, "has their liberality gone to
this&mdash;do horses talk? My dear William, you and I know
that asses have written before this; but for horses to
speak!"</p>

<p>"Perhaps, Willy," said the duchess, "it is merely yea
and nay, or probably only the female horses who talk
at all."</p>

<p>"Yes, mother, yes," said her son, "both of them spoke;
and not only that, but Nap, the dog you were once so fond<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_400" id="Page_400">[400]</a></span>
of, called after me to say, that we had no right to keep him
tied up in that dismal yard, and that he would appeal to
Parliament if we did not let him out.</p>

<p>"My dear duchess," said the duke, who was even more
alarmed at the spread of intelligence than her grace, "there
is but one thing for us to do&mdash;let us pack up all we can, and
if we can get a few well-disposed post-horses, before they
get too much enlightened, to take us towards the coast, let
us be off."</p>

<p>What happened further, this historical fragment does
not explain; but it is believed that the family escaped with
their clothes and a few valuables, leaving their property in
the possession of their assistants, who, by extending, with
a liberal anxiety (natural in men who have become learned
and great by similar means themselves), the benefits of
enlightenment, in turn gave way to the superior claims of
inferior animals, and were themselves compelled eventually
to relinquish happiness, power, and tranquillity in favour
of monkeys, horses, jackasses, dogs, and all manner of
beasts.</p>


<hr class="r15" />
<h3>SUNDAY BILLS.</h3>

<p>We regret to see that a well-meaning gentleman of the
name of Peter, is trying to get up a second edition of the
exploded Agnew absurdity. Whatever the object of these
efforts may be, it is clear that nothing can more effectually
tend to array the country in two classes against each other,&mdash;the
one of Atheists and Liberals, and the other of Puritans
and Fanatics.</p>

<p>How can a gentleman of honour, like Sir Andrew Agnew,
prevail upon himself&mdash;we are quite sure he is too independent
to permit any other person to prevail upon him&mdash;to declare
in the House of Commons that all classes of operatives are
anxious for the closest restrictions on the Sabbath which the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_401" id="Page_401">[401]</a></span>House can enforce? It is not the case. As far as working
goes, the operatives are at this moment entirely protected;
no master can compel his journeymen to work on Sunday;
and as for menial servants, they are excepted out of the bill.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<a name="ENV2" id="ENV2"></a>
<span class="lsp wsp">MULREADY ENVELOPE.</span>
<img src="images/i_400fp.jpg" alt="" />
<div class="caption">

[<em>See Hook's travestie on <a href="#ENV1">another page</a>.</em>]
</div></div>

<p>Does Sir Andrew Agnew believe, or wish anybody else to
believe, that the operatives want to be "cribbed, cabined,
and confined" on a Sunday, debarred from their excursions
to tea-gardens, their little voyages upon the river, their social
pipes and ale, or to have their wives and sweethearts mulcted
of their cakes and tea upon the only day in the week in which
they can enjoy them? Does he really mean seriously to say
that hard-working people, who for six consecutive days have
been shut up to labour and toil, in heated rooms, in factories,
or in gas-lit workshops, desire that they may be hindered
from breathing the pure air on the seventh?</p>

<p>And what to the poor&mdash;or, indeed, to the rich&mdash;is an
excursion without refreshment&mdash;without the enjoyment of
the Sunday's dinner, the weekly festival at which his family
enjoy his society, and in his society the treat of something
"good to eat?" Why may not these relations, if they
prefer good air to bad, go to those "Ordinaries on Sundays
at two o'clock," which may be seen announced on every
sign-board round London? or why, if they prefer it, may
they not travel thither in chaises or other carriages, if they
can afford it? Whether this is sinful or not, Messrs. Agnew
and Peter may perhaps decide; but of this we are sure,
that the operatives, except the already benighted Puritan
Radicals, must be, and are opposed, heart and soul, to the
monstrous restrictions which a couple of very small men are
endeavouring to bring them under, because they think it
right, and good, and wise.</p>

<p>The beneficial effects of the measure upon society may
be guessed from the following dialogue between Snip, a
tailor, and Snob, a shoemaker, living in the same house,
each having a wife&mdash;one having a child.&mdash;(<em>Time, Sunday
morning.</em>)</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_402" id="Page_402">[402]</a></span></p>

<p><em>Snip.</em> Vell, Snob, arn't you shaved? Vy, the bells is
a-going for Church&mdash;ye von't be ready in time.</p>

<p><em>Snob.</em> Church&mdash;bless your heart, I can't go to church
to-day&mdash;the bill's come into play.</p>

<p><em>Snip.</em> Ah! I know that to my cost.</p>

<p><em>Snob.</em> How can I go to church? Ve used to send our bit
of wittels to the bakus, and then I and Sal used to go to
church, and so give Jenny Walker sixpence to mind the
babby till we come back; then arter dinner Sal and I and
the babby used to go to Chalk Farm, as reglar as clockwork,
every blessed Sunday. She had a cup of the best bohea,
with milk hot from the cow&mdash;I smoked my pipe and had a
pint of ale. Little Jenny used to go to church in the arternoon,
and come and jine us, and so help bring babby
back. Now we marn't get the things baked at the bakus,
and Jenny marn't come and earn sixpence by looking arter
the babby&mdash;so Sal has to cook the wittels, and I have to
mind the child&mdash;so there's no church for us.</p>

<p><em>Snip.</em> My missus says she won't do no work Sundays,
cause she's afeard of her life of Bill Byers&mdash;so we avn't got
a morsel of grub for dinner, and neither of us knows where
to get none&mdash;I won't go to church with this here beard on,
six days long; and Jim, him as is the barber over the way,
won't shave me for fear of the five pound penalty, so I shall
stop where I is.</p>

<p><em>Snob.</em> Come along into our place&mdash;my Sal isn't so partic'lar&mdash;she's
read the hact itself, and swears she's a hexception&mdash;we
got a line of mutton, vith the kidney in it, and a peck of
tatys&mdash;come along wi' your old woman, and let's be jolly.</p>

<p><em>Snip.</em> Jolly! Hark, Mr. S&mdash;&mdash;, there's one on 'em over
the way&mdash;don't ye know 'em?&mdash;that's one o' Byers's boys&mdash;if
he hears you laugh to-day, two-pun-ten for you.</p>

<p><em>Snob.</em> Peter's pence&mdash;eh?&mdash;well, if we maint speak of a
Sunday in the street, let's come in&mdash;ours, you know, is a
back room, up two pair&mdash;they can't hear us there&mdash;come
along&mdash;I say, what shall we have to drink?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_403" id="Page_403">[403]</a></span></p>

<p><em>Snip.</em> There's nothing but vater for us as can't afford vine&mdash;public-houses
is shut&mdash;no sarving Sabbath-day.</p>

<p><em>Snob.</em> Vell, never mind&mdash;ve'll try and cheat the old un.
There are cunninger dogs than the law-makers, and them is
the law-breakers. Go and ask missus to come and join
us.</p>

<p><em>Snip.</em> Oh, she'll come, and jump too; and I tells ye what&mdash;as
we know'd we could not have no heavy wet to-day, she
got a couple of bottles of Jacky, as will nourish us through
the arternoon.</p>

<p><em>Snob.</em> So it will, Bill; and we won't stir out at all. If
we can't have a drop o' short, or a swig o' heavy among the
rurals in the harbours&mdash;what's the country to us, we can't
live upon hair?</p>

<p><em>Snip.</em> No, not by no means. If I could but get my chin
scraped, I'd try and make myself comfortable.</p>

<p><em>Snob.</em> Is barber Jem at home?</p>

<p><em>Snip.</em> Yes, shut up in his back parlour a-making wigs,
where nobody can see him.</p>

<p><em>Snob.</em> I tell ye vot, let's ax him to eat a bit of our
mutton. He han't got nobody to cook for him, poor buffer,
so we'll ax him over; and then if he brings his soap and a
kipple of razors in his vestcoat pockets, he can shave us two,
just by way of amusement, while Sal's getting the line
ready.</p>

<p><em>Snip.</em> Amusement!&mdash;that's quite gone out,&mdash;there's my
poor missus, who used to get from eighteen to four-and-twenty
shillings a-week a-manty making in Crambo Alley,
can't get a stitch o' work to do&mdash;nobody wears nothing now&mdash;they
used only to put on their bits of things onest a-week,
to show 'em like, and now they marnt go out a-pleasuring o'
Sundays, they buys nothing.</p>

<p><em>Snob.</em> Vell, come along up stairs, we'll have a day on it.
please the pigs; your two bottles of Jacky will last us till
bed-time, and I'll toss you up who pays for both&mdash;I'm not
going to swelter out in the sun to walk.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_404" id="Page_404">[404]</a></span></p>

<p><em>Snip.</em> Nor I&mdash;I'll be with you in a twinkling, and when
we have got my missus and barber Jem, we'll just lock the
door, and drink confusion to the reformers.</p>

<p>For the sequel we have not room in detail. Snip, Snob,
and barber Jem, ensconced in their fast-hold, pass the
Sabbath with the females, in hidden intoxication and carefully-concealed
profligacy&mdash;drunkenness progresses. Barber
Jem contributes from his store over the way to the replenishment
of the gin-bottle. Jealousy grows out of familiarity:
the women tear each other's caps, and scratch each other's
faces. Snob knocks Snip over the balusters, and barber Jem
is taken to the station-house dead-drunk.</p>

<p>In better society things will grow even worse. The mind
restricted to drudgery through the week must have relaxation
at the end of it; and the tradesmen and clerks, and their
ladies, sweethearts, and wives, have a right, in this Christian
and civilized country, to share the innocent pleasures of the
male part of the creation on the only day upon which they
can properly enjoy them. What can be more innocent than
going to Richmond, walking upon the hill, or paddling about
by the water? What more agreeable or healthy than
steaming to Gravesend (where the animosity of the people
towards the aristocracy has recently been evinced by their
conduct towards the Pier)? What more natural than to eat
and drink when arrived there?&mdash;No; that is contrary to the
law. What! of nature or nations!&mdash;No; of Agnew and of
Peter. Surely if young ladies are satisfied with soles and
eels, and ducks and peas, and sage and onions, and port wine
and punch, and such things as these, all eaten fairly and
above-board at open windows or in the open air, such persons
as Peter and Agnew should rejoice thereat. Confine them in
London, deny them harmless gaiety, pen them up with their
lovers and friends, tell them they must not stir out, and, like
the Snips and Snobs of inferior life, they will turn their
thoughts into other channels, and soles and eels, and ducks
and peas, will shortly sink in their estimation, only, however,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_405" id="Page_405">[405]</a></span>
to give place to a catalogue of other things too numerous to
mention in the short space of an advertisement.</p>

<p>Oh, if these Agnews and Peters would but be content to
take man as God has been pleased to make him, and allow
him the free agency with which the Divinity has invested
him, how much more wisely would they act! If they themselves
believe that piety consists in eating cold meat on
Sundays, in avoiding carriages, in eschewing all sorts of
social conversation; if they see perdition in a plum-bun, and
utter destruction in a glass of mild ale, let them henceforth
live on frigid sheep, moan, mump, and be miserable, and
fast, and grieve, in direct opposition to the spirit and
character of Christians, observing the Protestant Sunday;
but do not let them meddle with matters which cannot
concern them, and by their success in which they would
infallibly corrupt the body of the people, and endanger the
safety of the commonwealth.</p>

<hr class="r15" />
<h3>ERRORS OF THE PRESS.</h3>

<p><span class="smcap">Sir</span>,&mdash;We hear a great deal of the licentiousness of the
press, and I am not disposed to say that there may not be
some good grounds for the complaint; but I beg to assert that,
to my own knowledge, much is charged to the account of the
licentiousness which is, in truth, only attributable to the
errors of the press; and I have had the mortification to see<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_410" id="Page_410">[410]</a></span>
articles of the most innocent information, from my own pen,
conveyed to the public with all the colour of libels, by the
mere mistake of a single letter.</p>

<p>For instance, I had occasion to report that a certain "noble
lord was confined to his house with a violent cold;" next
morning, I found that this innocuous piece of intelligence was
metamorphosed into a direct inroad on the peace of a noble
family, by representing his lordship as being "confined with
a violent scold." In the same way, on the occasion of a
recent entertainment given by a noble leader of fashion, I had
said, very truly, "that, amidst the festivities, the first point
of attraction and admiration were her ladyship's looks:" this
deserved compliment was changed by the printer into a satire
on the whole company, as if the chief point of attraction had
been "her ladyship's cooks." In a description of the regatta
at Cowes, I was made to represent a lady of fashion as
having formed a hasty and ill-assorted match "with a boy,"
when, in fact, I had only said that the Lady Louisa had,
indeed, broken adrift, but had "luckily, before any mischief
was done, been made fast to a buoy."</p>

<p>When I reported that "Lord A. had entertained Colonel
B., Major C., the Hon. Mr. D., and a few other fashionable
friends at dinner," I little expected to find these gentlemen
represented as a company of "fashionable fiends." At the
particular request of an eminent coachmaker, I mentioned
that a noble person, well known for his good taste in equipages,
and who happens to have a large and fine family, had
launched "a new green cab;" but judge of my horror at
seeing it stated, that "his lordship had, this season, brought
out another green cub." And I have lately had the misfortune
of being the involuntary cause of what is called a
hoax upon the public: having announced that Lord K. had
made a bet that he would "trot a mile" on the Harrow Road
in three minutes, an immense crowd assembled, and was
ready to proceed to outrage because his lordship did not
"trot a mule," as the printer's error had led them to expect.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_411" id="Page_411">[411]</a></span></p>

<p>Of a more serious kind are the injuries done to private
individuals, which no one deplores more than I&mdash;the innocent
cause of them. I was once employed to recommend to
public attention the astonishing talents and performances of
that musical wonder "The infant Lyra." I did my best;
but the printer gave the whole a most unhappy and malicious
appearance by making me, by the transposition of a letter,
attribute all these prodigies to "the Infant Lyar." On a late
occasion, one of the papers talked of "the general satisfaction
given by the royal lump." This looked like a brutal allusion
to the temporary illness of an illustrious duke. The truth
was, Mr. Editor, that I myself penned that paragraph for an
ingenious artist in Bond Street, in order to recommend an
improved kind of argand, which he denominated the "Royal
Lamp;" and I never can sufficiently regret the injustice done
to the gallant General Saldanha, who, in an account of his
conduct at Oporto, which I drew up under his own eye, was
stated to have "behaved like a hero;" but when it came to
be printed, it unhappily appeared as if the general had
"behaved like a hare."</p>

<p>What I wrote of "the Horticultural fête" was altered into
"the Horticultural fate," as if there was a destiny affecting
all the entertainments of that society. When the late Mr.
Canning offered Lord F. the office of "Secretary of State,"
the public were led by a mere transposition of the letters, to
believe that a new office was to be instituted under the title
of "Secretary of Taste;" and what gave the more effect to
this mistake was the noble lord's admitted fitness for the latter
office. I once ventured to bear my humble testimony to the
assiduous attendance of a certain reverend dean on the
"Minster," but had the mortification to find myself insinuating
blame against the worthy divine, for his assiduous
attendance on the "Minister;" and what was still worse,
having to communicate the deserved elevation of "Doctor
Jebb" to an Irish mitre, I was made to announce that
"Doctor Jobb" was to be the new Irish Bishop. I remember<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_412" id="Page_412">[412]</a></span>
reporting the case of a poor French lady, who "appeared at
Bow Street with her pug-dog in her arms," but the printer
most ungallantly stated the fair stranger to have appeared
"with a pig in her arms;" and on the next day of her
attendance a vast crowd had assembled to look at this extraordinary
pet, and the poor Frenchwoman narrowly escaped
being pelted for disappointing their expectations. In something
the same way, a respectable tradesman in Oxford Street
has had his shop-windows broken, to the loss of near ten
pounds, because, having invited the public to inspect his
extensive assortment of a fine manufacture called "linos,"
the printer chose "to invite the public to inspect a large
assortment of the finest lions."</p>

<p>I am, sir, a warm friend of his Majesty's Government (for
the time being), and cannot but deeply feel that even my
political views are sometimes distorted. Amongst the benefits
to be expected from recent measures in Ireland, I had
enumerated the "increase of tillage,"&mdash;this was changed
into increase of "pillage," and copied into all the ultra-Tory
papers; and when I said that these same measures of conciliation
would induce every loyal and well-disposed subject
to unite "in quieting Ireland," it was perverted into a sneer,
as if all loyal and well-disposed subjects should unite "in
quitting Ireland."</p>

<p>Pray, sir, do me the justice to lay this explanatory letter
before the public; above all, let it be correctly printed.</p>

<p class="right padr4">I am, sir, your humble servant,</p>
<p class="right smcap">A Court Reporter.</p>

<p>We very often suffer in a similar manner. About two
years since, we represented Mr. Peel as having joined a party
of "fiends" in Hampshire for the purpose of shooting
"peasants;" and only last week, in a Scotch paper, we saw
it gravely stated that a "surgeon" was taken alive in the
river, and sold to the inhabitants at 6d. and 10d. per lb.</p>

<h3>THE VISIT TO WRIGGLESWORTH<a name="FNanchor_63" id="FNanchor_63"></a><a href="#Footnote_63" class="fnanchor">[63]</a></h3>

<p>It is said that a certain place not mentionable to "ears
polite" is paved with "good intentions." Whether it will
ever be macadamized (for that, I believe, is the term for
"unstoning," now fast gaining ground, as I am looking over
my paper, which, in all probability, everybody else will overlook)
I cannot pretend to say; but certain it is, that although
I was beyond measure mortified by the results of the Twickenham
prank, my exclusion from the society of the Miss
Dods, and my absolutely necessary escape from an association
with them, I was very soon reconciled to my fate after the
arrival of Devil Daly (as I used subsequently to call him) at
my lodgings in Suffolk Street.</p>

<p>The instant he had been dislodged from the cottage by the
appearance of the young ladies whose family he had so seriously
outraged on the previous evening, instead of walking
his horse back to Smart's, at the Toy, at Hampton Court, he
cantered up to visit me in London; not so much from any
particular affection for me, but because, although himself the
victim, there was something so exciting and delightful to him
in a joke, that he could not deny himself the pleasure of
narrating to me the history of the arrival of the sylphs, and
his extraordinary ruse of the bleeding nose. I never saw him
in higher spirits, and, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">quoad</i> my resolutions, I could not, for
the life of me, refuse to join him in a stroll about town, which,
although the season was somewhat advanced, was yet agreeably
full, with a pledge to dine with him somewhere afterwards.</p>

<p>In those days clubs were scarce, although <em>then</em> hearts were
plenty; there were no clubs of note at that period but
White's, Brookes's, and Boodle's. To be sure, there was the
Cocoa Tree, and there was Graham's, but the number of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_414" id="Page_414">[414]</a></span>
members was small, the system confined, and therefore, although
Daly and I were as proud as Lucifer, and as "fine as
fine could be," men had no resource when they wished to
enjoy the "feast of reason and the flow of soul"&mdash;the one
in the shape of a cutlet, and the other in the tapering form of
a bottle of claret&mdash;but to repair to a coffee-house, a place
which, I find, is now (I speak while I am arranging my
papers) obsolete&mdash;a dear, nice, uncomfortable room, with a
bar opening into it, a sanded floor, an argand lamp smoking a
tin tray in the middle of its ceiling, boxes along its sides, with
hard carpet-covered benches, schoolboy tables, and partitions,
with rods, and rings, and curtains, like those of a churchwarden's
pew in a country church.</p>

<p>I selected Dejex's, at the corner of Leicester Place. Attention
and civility, a good <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">cuisine</i>, and good wine, formed its
particular attractions, and the courteous attention of "mine
host" gave a new zest to his cookery and his claret. I own
I love attention and civility&mdash;not <em>that</em> which seems to be
extracted by dint of money, or by force of the relative situations
of guest and landlord, but that anxious desire to please,
that consideration of one's little peculiarities, and that cheerfulness
of greeting which, even if it be assumed, is always
satisfactory. To Dejex's we resolved to go, and having
"secured our box" and taken our stroll, we found ourselves
seated and served by a little after six o'clock.</p>

<p>There was something irresistibly, practically, engaging
about Daly, and I never felt more completely assured of the
influence over me of a man with whom I had been so short a
time acquainted, than I was when I found myself again&mdash;in
the course of eight and forty hours&mdash;associated with him in
a place which, of all others, was the most likely to afford him
some opportunity of exhibiting his eccentricities; for the
company consisted in a great degree of <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">emigrés</i> of the ancient
<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">régime</i>, who, until the master-hand of Wellington was raised
to cut the Gordion knot of their difficulties, which negotiation
had for years in vain attempted to untwist, "had made Eng<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_415" id="Page_415">[415]</a></span>land
the asylum for their persecuted race." Yet, however much
their misfortunes&mdash;the natural results of anarchy and revolution&mdash;might
excite our sympathies and demand our assistance, some
of them, it must be admitted, were, to our then unaccustomed
eyes, extremely strange specimens of humanity; they were
what Mr. Daly, in his peculiar phraseology, called "uncommon
gigs;" and one very venerable <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">ci-devant</i> marquis, who
wore spectacles, the said Daly, as he advanced up the room,
somewhat too loudly, I thought, pronounced to be "a gig
with lamps."</p>

<p>However, we got through dinner, and had safely demolished
our admirable <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">omelette soufflée</i> without any outbreaking on the
part of my mercurial companion; the coffee-room began to
thin, and I began to be more at my ease than before, when
Daly proceeded to recount some of his adventures, which
proved to me that, however deeply the scene of the preceding
day at Twickenham might have impressed itself on <em>me</em>, it
was to <em>him</em> a "trifle light as air."</p>

<p>"But how," said I, "shall I ever reconcile the Dods? I
am destined to meet those people; you are not."</p>

<p>"I was destined to meet them this morning," replied Daly,
"and, if it had not been for this 'bleeding piece of earth,'"
laying hold of his nose, "I could not well have escaped; but
for you, rely upon it, it will all turn out right. In a week
they will have utterly forgotten you."</p>

<p>"What," said I, "will Fanny so soon lose all recollection
of me?"</p>

<p>"To be sure she will," said Daly. "As somebody says,</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<p class="verse">'Fancy's visions, like the sand,</p>
<p class="verse4">Every idle mark receive;</p>
<p class="verse">Lines are traced by every hand,</p>
<p class="verse4">Which no lasting impress leave.'"</p>
</div></div></div>

<p>"But <em>her</em> hand," said I.</p>

<p>"You took and shook," replied he, "and very wisely too;
but recollect it was nearly dark when we made our exit."</p>

<p>"And you insulted the father&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_416" id="Page_416">[416]</a></span></p>

<p>"&mdash;&mdash;who first affronted <em>me</em>," said Daly; "and even if
the girls <em>did</em> know me this morning, and recognise me as
assistant clerk to the deputy-assistant surveyor of the Paddington
Canal Company, the deuce is in it if the whole family
must not respect me as a high-minded, honourable, and
conscientious assistant clerk."</p>

<p>"Yes, but it was quite light enough when we arrived,"
said I, "to see them and their beauties; why not light enough
for them to see our deformities?"</p>

<p>"Deformities!" said Daly; "speak for yourself, Mr.
Gurney; women don't care so much for men's beauty as you
may suppose. Here am I&mdash;plain, but genteel, like a Wedgwood
teapot&mdash;I make my way, and whatever you may think
of yourself and Miss Fanny, I flatter myself Gussy, as her
ma' called her, was equally well pleased with your humble
servant."</p>

<p>"And yet we may never see either of them again," said I.</p>

<p>"I am not so sure of that," said Daly; "I have done
worse to a father than I did to Dod in the course of my life,
and yet have come to be domesticated in the family afterwards."</p>

<p>"As how?" said I.</p>

<p>"Some three years since," said Daly, "I was down at my
friend's Sir Marmaduke Wrigglesworth's, in Surrey&mdash;charming
place&mdash;nice wife&mdash;excellent shooting&mdash;capital cook&mdash;and
inexhaustible cellars. 'Marmaduke,' said I, 'I hate battues;
here you have a party staying for the wholesale slaughter of
pheasants&mdash;eleven double barrels all of a row&mdash;more chance
of homicide than sport; do me the kindness to let me off,
and permit me to "range the fields" by myself, and I will
consent to be laughed at for my small gains when the card
comes in before dinner.' 'Do as you like,' said Wrigglesworth;
'this is Liberty Hall; shoot alone or in company&mdash;with
dogs or without&mdash;have the keeper or not&mdash;<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">comme il vous
plaira</i>.' Accordingly, away I went, more eager for the sport,
as having to render an account of my single exploits, young<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_417" id="Page_417">[417]</a></span>
enough to do my day's work well, and strong enough to bring
my day's work home. I admit I was not quite so well pleased
with what I saw, or rather what I did not see, as I went on:
birds were scarce, wild, and shy, and I did not get a shot for
the first hour, except at a venerable rabbit, who had retired
from public life, but who had somewhat incautiously left his
tail out of the burrow which he had selected for his final
retreat; at him I went, and he died&mdash;first tenant of my bag."</p>

<p>"A tenant in tail," said I, punning professionally.</p>

<p>"Well, sir," continued Daly, who never stopped for anybody,
"on I went, until at last, after three hours' ploughing
and plodding, I fell in with one of the nicest little snug copses
you ever set your eyes on. In I went&mdash;whurr went the
pheasants&mdash;bang went the barrels&mdash;down came the birds&mdash;and,
by the time I had crossed the copse, three cocks and&mdash;<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">heu
mihi!</i>&mdash;two hens graced my store."</p>

<p>"Pretty sport for the time," said I.</p>

<p>"No sooner, however," said Daly, "had I emerged from
the thicket, than I found myself upon a sort of parkish-looking
lawn, on the rise of which stood a very respectable
house, at the door of which I could distinguish a group of
persons standing, and from the court-yard of which I saw
some sort of servant leading forth a stout short-legged pony,
with a thick neck and a stumpy tail&mdash;evidently master's
favourite&mdash;equal to fourteen stone, warranted never to shy,
trip, or stumble. Upon its back did I see a portly gentleman
bestride himself, and forthwith begin to canter towards me,
followed at a somewhat splitting pace by two keepers on
foot, each armed either with guns or sticks, which I could
not easily distinguish."</p>

<p>"I foresee," said I.</p>

<p>"So did I," said Daly; "the moment I saw the governor
coming full tilt, I knew I had been trespassing, and the
moment I stepped upon his infernal lawn, felt that I had
put my foot into it."</p>

<p>"Well," said I, "what happened?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_418" id="Page_418">[418]</a></span></p>

<p>"Why," continued Daly, "I standing still, and he moving
somewhat rapidly, the elder of the two had the best of it,
and I was very soon within six inches of his cob's nose, and
within about half a yard of his own. 'You are a pretty
fellow, sir,' said the irate gentleman, 'to come poaching and
killing the birds in my preserves, close to my house&mdash;why,
what the devil are you thinking of, you rascal? Here,
Stephens&mdash;Thomson&mdash;&mdash;'</p>

<p>"'Sir,' said I, 'I am extremely sorry&mdash;&mdash;'</p>

<p>"'Sorry,' interrupted Mr. Bagswash&mdash;(for such was the
gentleman's name)&mdash;'sorry, yes, and well you may be sorry;
Botany Bay is too good for a fellow like you, sir. Lay
hands on him.'</p>

<p>"'One moment, sir,' said I, 'I am a gentleman.' Whereupon
Squire Bagswash and his keepers burst into an unseemly
fit of laughing.</p>

<p>"'A pretty gentleman too,' said Bagswash.</p>

<p>"'I thank you, sir,' said I, 'I don't want compliments,
I only want a hearing. I am staying on a visit at Sir
Marmaduke Wrigglesworth's, and here is my card.' Saying
which I produced&mdash;from what I happened by the merest but
luckiest accident in the world to have about me, my card-case&mdash;my
visiting ticket.</p>

<p>"'Young man,' said my opponent, having read it, 'is
this genuine? My name, sir, is Bagswash; I am personally
known to Sir Marmaduke. Is what you are saying true?'</p>

<p>"'Sir,' said I, 'I am not accustomed to have my word
doubted. I admit, that not being perfectly acquainted with
the boundaries of the Wrigglesworth property, I have transgressed
and trespassed. I am sorry for it; and sorry that
you should have so far forgotten yourself as to use language
which, I am quite sure, in a more temperate mood you
would regret.'</p>

<p>"'Sir,' said Bagswash, half doubting, and certainly more
than half fearing me, 'I don't know that I have used any
strong expressions, I&mdash;'</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_419" id="Page_419">[419]</a></span></p>

<p>"'Rascal, I think,' said I, bowing profoundly.</p>

<p>"'If I did, I&mdash;really,' said Bagswash, 'I&mdash;might&mdash;but
I was irritated&mdash;sir, this is my manor.'</p>

<p>"'Why, sir,' said I, 'as to your manner, I <em>do</em> think it
might have been a little more courteous&mdash;I&mdash;&mdash;'</p>

<p>"'Yes, sir,' said my antagonist, who evidently was
anxious to justify his coarseness and vulgarity, 'but&mdash;the
manor, I mean&mdash;for I can't pun, sir, and I hate puns, sir; the
manor, I mean, costs me a very large sum annually&mdash;a very
large sum indeed, sir, to preserve; and therefore when I see
what I conceive to be a poacher immediately under my nose,
actually in my homestead&mdash;upon my lawn, I may say&mdash;shooting
right and left, it <em>does</em> put me in a passion, and
I own I was warm, and perhaps hasty; but it <em>is</em> a provocation,
and I should like to know, under all the circumstances,
what <em>you</em> yourself would say if you were <em>me</em> at this moment?'</p>

<p>"'Say, sir!' said I; 'I haven't the smallest hesitation
about that, sir. If I were <em>you</em> at this moment, I should say,&mdash;"Mr.
Daly, I beg your pardon for the hasty way in
which I spoke when I thought you a poacher; and, in order
to show that although passionate I am not vindictive, I hope,
as it is just luncheon-time, and you must have walked a long
way and haven't had very good sport, that you will do me
and Mrs. Bagswash the favour to come in and take a cutlet,
or a little cold meat, as the case may be, and make up our
differences with a glass or two of wine."</p>

<p>"'By Jove,' cried Bagswash, 'you are a queer fellow&mdash;the
very spit of your father, whom I knew before I retired
to these parts.'</p>

<p>"'Oh,' whispered one of the keepers to the other, 'master
does know him&mdash;he <em>had</em> a father.'</p>

<p>"'Oh,' said the other; and they both immediately lowered
their sticks to the ground.</p>

<p>"'And,' continued the squire, 'you have only just anticipated
me in an invitation, except that I apprehended some
more serious requisition on <em>your</em> part.'</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_420" id="Page_420">[420]</a></span></p>

<p>"'Not a bit, sir,' said I; 'there are a vast many gentlemen
in the world who don't look like gentlemen, and the
shooting jacket and gaiters equalise appearances so much,
that Nature must have done a vast deal to give a man an
aristocratic appearance under so rough a husk&mdash;but as to
any meeting, except at your hospitable table, I have not the
slightest wish for it. In my opinion, sir, one luncheon is
preferable to two balls.'</p>

<p>"'Ah!' said Bagswash, 'I am glad o' that, in spite of
your pun. Run up, Stephens, and tell them to get luncheon
as soon as possible. Mr. Daly, a friend of Sir Marmaduke
Wrigglesworth, is coming to join our family party.'"</p>

<p>"Well, Daly," said I, "there your presence of mind
served you well."</p>

<p>"Hear the sequel," said Daly. "Encouraged by the
acquiescence of Bagswash, as I was yesterday by the
invitation of Dod, I proceeded towards the house, placing,
ever and anon, my hand on the neck of his cob, or the
pommel of the saddle, in order to mark to the distant group
the familiar nature of our acquaintance; and in this fashion
we reached the mansion, upon the steps of which a bevy of
graces, in number more like the Muses, welcomed us. I <em>had</em>
a reputation even then, and the moment the girls had heard
who was coming, they made up their minds to mirth&mdash;even
the big Mrs. Bagswash rolled herself into the hall, like a
fillet of veal upon castors, to do me honour.</p>

<p>"Bating the parents," continued Daly, "I never saw a
more prepossessing family. I forget all their names; but one
was slim and sylph-like, another plump and pleasant, a third
a wicked-looking brunette, a fourth a demure and bashful
blonde: all I felt as I entered the house was, that if I had
brought eight friends with me, I might, by giving each his
choice, have had some one of the 'tuneful nine' left entirely
to myself."</p>

<p>"And," said I, "were you the only man?"</p>

<p>"No," replied Daly, "there were two yahoos, in white<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_421" id="Page_421">[421]</a></span>
cord breeches and leather gaiters, and a boy with a frill and
a frock, upon which a favourable eruption of brass sugar-loaf
buttons had taken place; a Dr. Somebody, who turned
out to be the nearest apothecary; and a very pale, long-legged
youth, the curate of the parish."</p>

<p>"A largeish luncheon-party," said I.</p>

<p>"Well," said Daly, "I sat down, having first very much
ingratiated myself with old Bagswash, who was as chary of
his pheasants as if they had been of the golden breed, by
insisting upon it that his man Stephens should disencumber
my bag of the birds which I had shot on his land, retaining
my solitary rabbit, in order to grace my tale when I reached
Wrigglesworth; and there I found myself placed between
mine hostess, and number one of the daughters&mdash;a very nice,
pretty thing&mdash;not what one should call well set up, but
Nature, as I said about gentlemen to her papa, had done a
great deal for her; poor thing, how I pitied her!&mdash;and pity
is akin to love. So, after luncheon, and <em>some</em> wine, do <em>you</em>
know, Gurney, I almost began to subside into a tenderer
feeling. But then, one of nine!"</p>

<p>"Well, and how did it end?" said I.</p>

<p>"Why," replied Daly, "it would have ended, I have no
doubt, as prosperously as it begun, had not my new friend,
Bagswash, committed himself by begging me to drink some
London Particular Madeira&mdash;Duff, Murphy, Gordon, or
something of that sort. The moment I tasted it I knew
what it was, and, rather elated by circumstances, and my
other previous libations, I had the temerity to address the
dear, interesting, white-necked creature next me, and, in
a tone of confidential condolence, begged her not to be
deceived, for that although her amiable papa might be a judge
of other things, he evidently knew nothing of wine, and that
the stuff he called 'London Particular' was neither more
nor less than infernally bad Teneriffe.</p>

<p>"The male Bagswash was unconscious of the imputation,
but the queen B. overheard me, and, looking towards what<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_422" id="Page_422">[422]</a></span>
might literally be called her open countenance, I saw
symptoms of fire breaking out, and in less than a minute
afterwards the domestic Proserpine exclaimed 'Come, girls,
let us go&mdash;too much of your <em>pa's</em> Tenreefe will do you a
mischief.' Up she got, and out she wheeled herself, and
the moment she set the example, away went the nine she
Bagswashes, like so many goslings after the maternal goose.</p>

<p>"I," continued Daly, "regretted the retreat, for I had
had an opportunity to insinuate myself, and never saw
an audience more thoroughly prepared to be gratified;
indeed, so convinced were they, from what they had heard
of me, that I was a vastly agreeable person, and talked
epigrams, that when, while they were all sitting with their
ears open to catch my <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">facetiæ</i>, I happened to observe (the
first observation I had made, too, and that, in reply to a
question of the big Bagswash) that I thought mustard went
remarkably well with cold boiled beef, they all burst out
into an immoderate fit of laughter; and the doctor, who had
been tutored into a belief in my superlative wit, exclaimed,
'Oh, oh, that's too bad!' which every fool cries out, either
when he thinks a thing remarkably good, or does not comprehend
it in the least, which last was the case&mdash;as indeed
it was with all the rest of the party&mdash;with my new-found
medical friend."</p>

<p>"Did you contrive," said I, "to affront the rest of the
company before you quitted it?"</p>

<p>"Not all of them," said Daly; "no; I believe I got off
pretty well, but evidently the worse for wear; for, Teneriffe
or not Teneriffe, it is my maxim to stick to the wreck as
long as she floats, and as long as I could get anybody to sit,
I staid; the curate and the boy with the frill went with the
ladies, but Bagswash and the parish Paracelsus remained.
However, at last, seeing all the bottles empty, and no disposition
on the part of Baggy to replenish, I made a move,
and never did I see a man more happy at having got out of
a scrape than mine host. He sent his kindest regards to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_423" id="Page_423">[423]</a></span>
the Wrigglesworths&mdash;hoped to see me soon again&mdash;did I
know my road home? In short, I cannot enumerate the
civilities he heaped upon me, which, considering his respect
for my friend Sir Marmaduke, and the fact of his having
nine unmarried daughters, I duly appreciated, and forthwith
bent my way homewards."</p>

<p>"Glad, I should think," said I, "to be safe out."</p>

<p>"On the contrary," said Daly, "I should like to have
remained where I was; if it had not been for the anger of
the respectable cat-of-nine-tails about the Teneriffe, it would
have been a very agreeable domicile. However, once started,
onwards I went, rejecting, indignantly, the offer of Bagswash
to send a man to show me the way;&mdash;nothing I hate so
much; as if a man who had followed his nose into a place
could not follow his nose out of it."</p>

<p>"I trust," said I, "that your intrepidity was crowned
with success?"</p>

<p>"Rather crippled," replied Daly, "as you shall hear;
however, there are two ends to my story, or, rather, a story
and a sequel."</p>

<p>"Pray go on," said I, knowing that so long as his breath
lasted, his tongue would wag, as a cherry-clapper does while
the wind blows.</p>

<p>"Gad, sir," said he, "I walked off&mdash;I admit the Teneriffe
to have been potent&mdash;and I thought of one thing, and
another thing, and I believe I thought of all the things in
the world, except the way which I was going. They say,
you know, some men have every sense but common sense&mdash;my
case to a hair. Common sense is like flour; the other
sort of sense is like sugar and gilding, and all the rest of
those things&mdash;beautiful to adorn a cake and embellish the
<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">pâtisserie</i>, but, without the flour, mere ornaments; now,
without the ornaments, the flour will make bread. I never
had the flour&mdash;never shall have. So you perceive that the
sugar and the flummery being my staple, on I went and went,
until I began to think I had missed my way, and just then I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_424" id="Page_424">[424]</a></span>
found myself stopped by a gate opening into&mdash;or, rather,
shutting me out of&mdash;a remarkably well-stocked farm-yard&mdash;ricks,
stacks, stables, barns&mdash;everything comfortable and convenient;
with half a million cocks and hens, walking about
like ladies and gentlemen, all as happy as happy could be.
Over the gate I stepped, waded my way through the straw,
and, leaning over the hatch of one of his outhouses, who
should I see but the farmer himself. As I advanced, he touched
his hat, and civilly asked whether I had had much sport?</p>

<p>"'Not much,' said I, recollecting that the whole contents
of my bag now amounted to one elderly rabbit, with a Cape
tail; 'I am on my way to Wrigglesworth, and out of it, too,
as I think. How far have I to go?'</p>

<p>"'Seven miles, I count,' said the farmer. 'You are
coming right away from it, sir. Wrigglesworth lies over
there, on your left.'</p>

<p>"'Thank you,' said I, 'thank you. If you will just give
me a sort of concise direction,&mdash;I am a dab at topography.
Merely give me the points, and I'll go across a country I
never saw in my life before.'</p>

<p>"'Well, sir,' said the kind fellow, 'if so be as that is the
case, I'll tell you. When you get out of the gate down
there, turn to your left, and keep on straight till you come
to Pussy's Nob; then away to the right, over Sumpter's
Green, and you'll soon see the Crooked Billet. Don't go
near that, but turn short round by Wheatley's Copse; keep
on, till you come to the stile on your left; go over that,
through Timsbury's Lane, and that will bring you out by
the Three Mackerel, and there they'll be sure to put you
in the right road.'</p>

<p>"'Thank you,' said I to the farmer, 'I will follow your
instructions most implicitly; but I suppose I shall have no
chance of getting a shot, now, in that direction&mdash;even at a
pheasant-roosting&mdash;eh?'</p>

<p>"'No, sir,' said the farmer, 'can't say as how I think
you will get many more shots this evening.'</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_425" id="Page_425">[425]</a></span></p>

<p>"'Well,' said I, 'now both my barrels are loaded. I've
got nothing in my bag but an old buck rabbit with a nob
tail; and as I hate going home with no proofs of my sport,
and the one head&mdash;or tail&mdash;that I have bagged takes the
domestic character, what shall I give you to have a shot
with both barrels at all those ducks in the pond, and the
fowls on the side of it, standing here, and to carry away
what I kill?'</p>

<p>"'You'll kill a woundy sight on 'em, I think, at that
distance,' said the considerate farmer.</p>

<p>"'Perhaps yes&mdash;perhaps no,' said I.</p>

<p>"'And to have all you kill?' said he, doubtingly.</p>

<p>"'Yes; all I kill fairly out-and-out,' said I.</p>

<p>"'Why, you shall give me half-a-guinea,' said the
man.</p>

<p>"'Half-a-guinea!' echoed I. 'No, no; if I kill three or
four of them it will be the outside. No; I'll tell you what
I'll do. I'll stand here&mdash;won't move an inch; and you
shall have a seven-shilling piece for the slaughter.'</p>

<p>"'Well, sir,' said the farmer, hitching up his lower
garments, 'a bargain's a bargain. Hand over the twine.'</p>

<p>"Whereupon," said Daly, "I tipped him that beautiful
miniature portrait of half-a-guinea, and told him I was ready
to take my shots. He nodded assent; and, having pocketed
the money, bade me proceed. I did so. Crack went one
barrel&mdash;bang! slap went the other&mdash;bang!&mdash;and such a
fluttering, and cackling, and squashing, and squabbling you
never heard. I ran forward, and secured, as my spoil, four
hens in high condition, a very respectable cock, fit companion
for my rabbit; and from the pond fished, with the butt-end
of my Manton, two extremely corpulent ducks, who had paid
the debt of nature in the most decided manner; these I got
out, the others I got up, and stuffed them all incontinently
into my bag, delighted to think what a display I should make
at Wrigglesworth, where it was quite clear I could, by no
possibility, arrive in time for dinner. However, that was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_426" id="Page_426">[426]</a></span>
<em>my</em> joke, and it seemed to be the farmer's; he laughed quite
as much as I did."</p>

<p>"Inherent good humour, I suppose," said I.</p>

<p>"Why, as for that," said Daly, "<em>you</em> shall judge. I
bagged my birds in the first instance; and then, having
secured my booty, began to rally my victim; and having
acknowledged his civility in giving me my travelling directions,
said to him, with a low bow, 'Thank you for the
game, sir.'</p>

<p>"'Yes, sir,' said the farmer, 'you are a deuced sight
better shot than I counted upon, considering what you had
in your bag afore.'</p>

<p>"'Yes,' said I, 'I think you are what you may call
"done." Seven shillings won't pay for the poultry in my
pouch, I guess.'</p>

<p>"'No,' said the farmer, 'nor three times the money, I count.'</p>

<p>"'Well, then,' replied I, 'I think I have the best of the
bargain.'</p>

<p>"'Not much,' said the man.</p>

<p>"'Not much!' cried I; 'why, a guinea's worth of fowls
for a seven-shilling piece&mdash;&mdash;'</p>

<p>"'Yees, sir, that's true,' said the fellow, turning slowly
away from the hatch, and grinning as he turned; '<em>but they
are none on 'em mine</em>.'</p>

<p>"I could have killed him for his roguery; but there was
so much fun in it&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"&mdash;&mdash;So much in your own way," cried I.</p>

<p>"Exactly so," said Daly; "that, instead of breaking his
head, which he most righteously deserved, I joined in his
infernal horse-laugh, and made the best of my way out of
the farm-yard, lest I should be immediately apprehended
by the right owner as a robber of hen-roosts."</p>

<p>"And," said I, "you carried home your spoils."</p>

<p>"Not I," exclaimed my unstoppable companion. "Take
some wine&mdash;help yourself&mdash;and listen; for the sequel is
most terrible. I had <em>such</em> a night of it!"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_427" id="Page_427">[427]</a></span></p>

<p>"How?" said I.</p>

<p>"Why," said Daly, "out of the gate I went, turned to
my left, and got to Pussy's Nob; but it began to get dusk,
and very soon afterwards dark; and when I began veering
away over Sumpter's Green, I found myself on a wide
common, without path, guide, or guide-post. As the darkness
increased, so did the declivity; and when I had lost all
power of seeing, I was gratified by feeling myself in a sort of
quagmire, which, for all I knew, might get softer and thicker
every step I took. I looked out for the stars, and saw
a few: but they were of no kind of use to me; for I had
not the slightest idea what direction, even under their
guidance, I ought to take. I resolved to avoid the bogs;
and kept edging away, until I at length reached a gap,
which, as it led off the infernal common, I hoped might
lead me to some habitation."</p>

<p>"Where spring-guns and steel-traps were set every night,"
said I.</p>

<p>"Not a bit of it," said Daly. "I went on, following my
nose, until I found myself at the edge of a copse, which I
began to think looked extremely like Squire Bagswash's preserve.
However, it was not <em>that</em>; but I heard people talking
at no great distance, and a call of 'Halloo!' How to act I
did not exactly know, with a gun and a bagfull of cocks and
hens, and a venerable rabbit to boot. What could I do?
To have answered the call would have been to be detected
as a poacher in the dark. I resolved, at all events, on
getting rid of my poultry in the first instance, and accordingly
emptied my store, rabbit, tail, and all, and proceeded
somewhat more gaily after having thrown out my ballast;
yet not without some apprehension, either of being shot by
the keepers for a poacher, or by the poachers for a keeper;
I so got clear of the whistling firs and moaning larches as
fast as I could, still utterly ignorant of my course."</p>

<p>"And getting late," said I.</p>

<p>"It must then have been past eight," said Daly. "On I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_428" id="Page_428">[428]</a></span>
trudged; scrambled over the furrows of one field, and
through the turnips in another; and so on and on, until at
last I was forced to sit myself down on a gate and rest; and,
I give you my word, although I have known a great deal of
the world, I never was so dead beat in my life as I was then.
Not a house could I see. The glimmering of a rushlight in
a cottage window would, in my eyes, have been thrice more
brilliant than the whole regalia of England collected. But no:
there were no cottages&mdash;no rushlights; and I do believe I
went the length of swearing at my own stupidity in undertaking
my solitary excursion. Only one set-off was there to
the whole thing;&mdash;I had seen the Bagswashes, male and
female, and laid in materials for an <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">historiette</i> for the next
evening&mdash;that is, if I really survived the present one; but I
began to feel cold, and hungry, and thirsty. However, it
appeared pretty certain that out of the fields I must get, if I
went straight on end, and could not well fail of fetching up
in a road somewhere at last."</p>

<p>"Which, as you are here alive to tell the tale," said I,
"of course you did."</p>

<p>"Why, yes," said Daly, "I did; but it was not for a
long time; and then I had come to a full stop; and, striking
the butt of my Manton on the ground, I swore, by stock and
barrel, that I would not budge from under a huge tree which
overshadowed me till daylight came to my aid. I was
ravenous&mdash;I was chilled&mdash;I was wretched&mdash;I was tired to
death; but why tire myself more?&mdash;and accordingly, feeling,
and I daresay looking, very like the dear Don of La Mancha,
I sat myself down with my back against the trunk, and, if
you'll believe me, fell fast asleep."</p>

<p>"Asleep!" said I.</p>

<p>"Fast as a church," said Daly, "and dreamt&mdash;dreamt,
first, that I was starving,&mdash;<em>that</em>, I think, must have been a
sort of waking vision; then, that I was at a ball; and then I
dreamt of being safe back at mine host's hospitable mansion;
and then I had a confused, hurly-burly kind of a dream,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_429" id="Page_429">[429]</a></span>
either that I was Sir Marmaduke Wrigglesworth, or that
Lady Wrigglesworth was Mrs. Daly, or something of that
sort, and that I tumbled out of bed, which tumble was to
me a 'dying fall;' for I rolled over on my side, and woke&mdash;in
no bed&mdash;in no house, but where I had lain me down,
under the tree before-mentioned."</p>

<p>"You must have caught your death of cold?" said I.</p>

<p>"No, Dalys and cats are very tenacious," said my jocular
friend; "I roused myself&mdash;sat up and listened&mdash;recollected
where I was, and heard at the same moment what was really
'sweet music to mine ear,' the sound of a bell-team. Ho!
ho! says I&mdash;you are <em>there</em>, are you?&mdash;where there are bells
there are horses&mdash;where there's a team there's a waggon&mdash;where
there's a waggon there's a road&mdash;up I jumped, and as
fast as I could, just roused from my slumbers, scrambled
over brambles and clambered over fences, until I caught
sight of the waggoner's lantern waggling on the side of the
tilt like a bright pendulum to regulate the wheels; the
moment I saw <em>that</em> I knew I was landed, and, after encountering
a few of those thumps and bumps which 'flesh is
heir to,' found myself on a high road. Waggons, even those
called 'flies,' may be overtaken, and although dead beat,
and sore of foot, I soon came up with the eight plaited-tailed
animals which were dragging the mountain, second only in
size to the Juggernaut idol.</p>

<p>"My first object was to ascertain where I was, and what
the direction of the vast pile before me. I found, to my particular
satisfaction, that I was within two miles of Ripley,
and that the edifice was moving towards London&mdash;the result
was, an involuntary spring upon the shafts of the vehicle,
and a look at the waggoner, which, by the light of his
revolver, was perfectly intelligible. The gun, the gaiters,
the grace, and the gentility, spoke the gentleman, and he
gave me leave to assume the post which he himself was
prevented by Act of Parliament from occupying. All my
sorrows fled the moment I felt myself moved along without<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_430" id="Page_430">[430]</a></span>
any personal exertion, and the smiles which had nearly been
exhausted during my toil and trouble, returned, as Moore
sings, to 'gild my brow.' 'I have had walking enough,'
said I to myself, 'and grieving enough&mdash;<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">nunc est ridendum</i>.'"</p>

<p>"Excellent wag!" said I.</p>

<p>"Excellent waggon, rather," said Daly, "for so it proved;
and after three-quarters of an hour's hard tugging by the
'<em>bell</em> assemblée' before me, I was dropped, gun, gaiters, bag,
and all, at the door of the Talbot&mdash;facing the Green. I
tipped my driver&mdash;bade adieu to the tilt&mdash;and began knocking
loudly at the door of mine ostlery."</p>

<p>"And a nice enough inn it is," said I.</p>

<p>"It turned out to be past midnight," said Daly; "and,
by the merest luck in the world, the exemplary widow who
then occupied it had not gone to her rest, or roost. She
personally answered my call, and replied to my knock.
After a few preliminary 'Who's there's?' she opened the
door; and the moment she recognised me&mdash;for I was well
known upon the road&mdash;her delight, as you may conceive,
was unspeakable.</p>

<p>"'Bless my heart, Mr. Daly,' said the widow, 'what a
time o' night to be strolling about with your gun! Why,
where do <em>you</em> come from?'</p>

<p>"'That,' said I, 'is about the last question in the world
I can answer satisfactorily. I have been wandering across a
country with which I am not particularly well acquainted&mdash;have
tired myself to death, and fallen asleep.'</p>

<p>"'Fallen indeed,' said mine hostess, 'into a ditch, Mr.
Daly, I should think. Why, dear me, what a condition you
are in!'</p>

<p>"'Exactly,' said I; 'recumbent repose in October under
an oak, is not particularly delicate; however, my darling,
give me some supper, some hot brandy and water, and
order me the most comfortable bed in the house, for I am
a-tired.'</p>

<p>"'Why, sir,' asked the dear woman, 'where is your<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_431" id="Page_431">[431]</a></span>
servant with your clothes&mdash;you cannot think of sleeping
here in that condition?'</p>

<p>"'Not exactly,' said I; 'I shall take off my clothes when
I go to bed&mdash;and as for my servant, he is snug and happy
at Sir Marmaduke Wrigglesworth's (where I ought to be
too), unless they have sent him out with a rake and a lantern
to search for me and drag all the horse-ponds in the neighbourhood.
I tell you I am hungry&mdash;and tired&mdash;and shall be
very sleepy;&mdash;out with your tit-bits and delicacies&mdash;something
piquant&mdash;nice&mdash;savoury, eh&mdash;and after that, a comfortable
nest.'</p>

<p>"'You shall have something to eat,' said the widow, 'and
something to drink, for those I can give you myself; but as
for a bed, I haven't one in the house&mdash;crammed full from top
to bottom.'</p>

<p>"'I'm very tired,' said I; I can sleep compact like a
dog on a hearth-rug&mdash;half a bed will do for me.'</p>

<p>"'Come, Mr. Daly,' said the landlady, 'none of your
nonsense&mdash;I have no bed whatever to-night, and here it is
almost one o'clock&mdash;you had better let me ring up the next
turn-out, and get back to Wrigglesworth.'</p>

<p>"'Thank you, Fanny,' said I; 'I used to call her Fanny
in her husband's time, and he was killed, switching a rasper,
three years before; 'not I&mdash;I should not get there till nearly
four&mdash;all the family "in a deep sleep buried,"&mdash;no, no&mdash;none
of <em>your</em> nonsense&mdash;where am I to rest?'</p>

<p>"'I told you the truth,' said the widow; 'there's not a
bed disengaged.'</p>

<p>"'Not one?' said I&mdash;looking, as I fancied, most insinuatingly,
and helping myself to a glass of brandy from a bottle
covered with a gilt bunch of grapes, at the same time gently
pressing the tip of mine hostess's little finger.</p>

<p>"'Not one, upon my life, Mr. Daly,' replied she; 'indeed,
we are so full, that my sister Jane, who is here, is obliged to
sleep with <em>me</em>.'</p>

<p>"'That's very unfortunate indeed,' said I; 'however, I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_432" id="Page_432">[432]</a></span>
rejoice that you have so much custom&mdash;all's good for trade&mdash;at
all events, let me eat&mdash;let me warm myself&mdash;both in the
sunshine of those bright eyes, and in the blaze of the parlour
fire.'</p>

<p>"Mine hostess proceeded to make me exceedingly comfortable&mdash;I
ate cold fowl and ham, and drank hot brandy
and water, and eventually punch. Mine hostess sipped
shrub&mdash;a liquor which, if it were <em>liqueur</em>, would rank fathoms
above either <ins class="corr" title="Transcriber's Note&mdash;Original text: 'Curaçoa'">Curaçao</ins> or Maraschino&mdash;till at last the clock
striking two, reminded her it was time to go to bed.</p>

<p>"'Ah,' said I, 'that is extremely just and proper. But,
alas! I am like my melancholy little friend who was "very
gentil, but whose hair came a leetle through the top of his
hat,"&mdash;I have no bed to go to.'</p>

<p>"'It's very provoking,' said the landlady, 'so tired as
you are, too.'</p>

<p>"'It is, indeed,' replied I&mdash;seeing a proposition of some
sort or other on the tip of her tongue.</p>

<p>"'Now,' said she, looking remarkably serious, 'can I trust
you&mdash;will you promise me, if I give you a bed, to do as I
bid you, Mr. Daly?'</p>

<p>"'Your commands,' said I, 'shall be obeyed to the letter&mdash;only
let me rest myself quietly and comfortably&mdash;it is all
I ask&mdash;for never was poor devil so tired in his life as I.'</p>

<p>"'Take a drop more punch, Mr. Daly,' said my landlady,
'it will make you sleep the sounder.'</p>

<p>"'No fear of that,' said I; 'but what do you propose?'</p>

<p>"'Why,' said mine hostess, 'I <em>have</em> one bed unoccupied.'</p>

<p>"'Why didn't you say so before?' cried I.</p>

<p>"'I'll tell you why,' said my fair friend; 'it's a double-bedded
room, and the other bed is occupied by a&mdash;&mdash;'</p>

<p>"'&mdash;&mdash;snoring farmer, from Farnham,' said I; 'or perhaps
a tight-skinned sailor, walking his way to town from
Portsmouth.'</p>

<p>"'No,' said she, looking very pathetic&mdash;and very pretty
by the way&mdash;'by a lady.'</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_433" id="Page_433">[433]</a></span></p>

<p>"'A lady,' said I, 'oh, charming thought!&mdash;&mdash;'</p>

<p>"'There it is,' interrupted the lady, 'that's just what I
expected, you are all fire and tow&mdash;alight in a moment&mdash;now
I shall not say another word, and you must sleep, if you
<em>will</em> sleep here, in the arm-chair by the fire.'</p>

<p>"'No,' said I, 'no&mdash;don't be angry&mdash;I didn't know&mdash;I
thought&mdash;&mdash;'</p>

<p>"'Yes, Mr. Daly, that's what you are always thinking, I
believe,' said mine hostess, 'but that won't do&mdash;the lady
who occupies the other bed in the double-bedded room is a
sad invalid; she has been stopping here for some time, and
the only rest she gets is by dint of laudanum, which the
doctor gives her in large doses, and she sleeps soundly
during the night, which makes up for the sufferings she
endures by day. If you choose to behave well&mdash;and, tired
as you are, I don't like to turn you out or leave you here&mdash;you
shall have the other bed. You must go gently into the
room, and when you are in bed I will come and take away
your candle; and as I sleep in the next room, if you don't
remain perfectly quiet I shall insist upon your getting up
and coming down again here into the bar.'</p>

<p>"'Agreed,' said I, 'I only ask for a bed&mdash;all I want is
rest&mdash;I am scarcely able to walk or stand, therefore I agree
to your condition; let me finish my punch, and marshal me
the way I should go.'</p>

<p>"After looking at me suspiciously and hesitatingly for a
minute or two, my dear landlady agreed to trust me; and
accordingly having seen that my bed was properly prepared
she returned, and, lighting a candle, preceded me upstairs,
and opening the door of the room put her finger to her lips to
enforce silence, whispering me, that when I was in bed I
should knock against the wainscot which separated her room
from that in which I was to repose, and that she would come
and fetch my candle.</p>

<p>"I promised to obey all her injunctions. The curtains of
the other bed were closely drawn&mdash;I never felt so awkward<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_434" id="Page_434">[434]</a></span>
in my life&mdash;but I had promised; yet one peep before the
light vanished&mdash;no&mdash;perhaps the lady would wake and
scream, and I should be forthwith ejected. I resolved to
keep my faith, at all events till mine hostess was herself
asleep, and then see&mdash;as far as utter darkness would permit&mdash;how
the affair would terminate.</p>

<p>"Accordingly, I hurried off my clothes&mdash;washed my face,
hands, and mouth as gently and quietly as possible, and
having concluded my brief preparations for depositing myself
on my much longed-for couch, gave the concerted signal, and
scarcely was well in my place before my dear landlady
entered the room on tip-toe, and, coming up close to the bedside
and having whispered 'Now, remember your promise,'
took the glimmering light away, and left me in the dark with
my fair and slumbering companion.</p>

<p>"There was something very strange in my position;
I was tired to death, but somehow I could not sleep. I lay
and listened to hear whether my fair <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">incognita</i> would sneeze&mdash;or
cough&mdash;or cry 'hem'&mdash;or play off any little coquettish trick
which, under the circumstances, I thought probable enough.
I durst not move, for <em>I</em> knew I was watched; however, I sat
up in the bed and began to wonder. Is it, thought I, an old
woman or a young woman?&mdash;an invalid is interesting, and,
bless her, she must be uncommonly genteel, for she does not
snore in the least&mdash;a few minutes served to convince me that
my landlady did&mdash;and I rather rejoiced in the sound of her
slumbers, since I thought I might perhaps succeed in attracting
the attention of my sleeping partner; and the fact that
a gentleman of my very respectable pretensions was so
whimsically associated with her&mdash;knowing mine hostess's
archness&mdash;induced me to attribute her readiness to quarter
me upon the slumbering beauty, to a foreknowledge on her
part that my introduction would not be considered altogether
an intrusion.</p>

<p>"After I had satisfied myself that my landlady was really
safe, I had recourse to some slight coughs, which do occa<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_435" id="Page_435">[435]</a></span>sionally
infest one; but no, my signals were not answered:
the dose of laudanum had been particularly strong that night.
At last I thought I heard a slight movement. I began to
listen till I heard the beating of my own heart, and felt a sort
of drumming palpitation in my ears. I held my breath: pshaw,
thought I, this woman has been cheating me, the other bed
is tenantless,&mdash;a trick to try me,&mdash;and for what a stupid dolt
she will set me down if I don't convince her that I had at
least curiosity enough in my composition to ascertain what
was in it.</p>

<p>"My feelings fired at the thought. Up I got,&mdash;groped my
way across the room,&mdash;the white dimity drapery being just
visible amidst the 'palpable obscure.' I reached the bed,&mdash;I
paused,&mdash;I heard nothing;&mdash;I partly opened the curtains
at the side, and said in a soft, <em>very</em> soft voice, 'Hem!' No
answer. 'Ma'am,&mdash;ma'am,' still silent;&mdash;'are you there?'
said I;&mdash;and, placing my hand on the pillow, found she was.
Dear, unconscious creature, there she lay, comfortably
cuddled up in the clothes, and sleeping, or seeming to sleep,
soundly. I was, I admit, on the point of proceeding to
awaken her, in order to announce my presence, when, in
stepping towards the head of the bed, my foot came in
contact with a chair which stood on its right-hand side,
which was overthrown with a crash that, in an instant,
roused&mdash;not my dear opium-drinker&mdash;but my lynx-like landlady.
I heard her jump out of bed. I jumped into mine,
but, in less than two minutes, there she was, like Margaret's
'grimly ghost,' standing before me, loading me with reproaches,
and ordering me, in the most peremptory terms, to
take the candle, descend the stairs, and dress myself in the
parlour behind the bar, and wait until she came down to
eject me from the house; seeing that she could have no kind
of confidence in a gentleman who had so much confidence in
himself.</p>

<p>"Vain were my pantomimic supplications: she would
listen to nothing but immediate abdication; and I could not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_436" id="Page_436">[436]</a></span>
well be angry with her, for she had put faith in me, and
perhaps run the risk of losing a valuable customer by
indulging me with the luxuries of ease and rest which, under
no other circumstances, she could have afforded me. I
implicitly obeyed her commands; and, as soon as she had
retired to dress herself, collected my wearing apparel, and
slunk downstairs to prepare for my departure, which seemed
inevitable. As I passed along the passages, I heard multifarious
snorings in all directions, which convinced me of the
truth of my landlady's assertions as to the influx of company,
and made me repent more sorely than before, that I could
not for once in my life act with discretion and decorum.</p>

<p>"I had scarcely finished dressing myself when my landlady
made her appearance in the parlour.</p>

<p>"'I really am surprised, sir,' said she, 'at your conduct.
I thought, as a gentleman, you might have been trusted, considering
the circumstances under which I ventured to put
you into that room.'</p>

<p>"'Really,' said I, 'I thought you were playing me a trick,
and I could not bear your having the laugh against me, and
so I certainly <em>did</em> venture just to ascertain&mdash;&mdash;'</p>

<p>"'Ascertain!' cried the landlady; 'that's just the very
thing you ought upon no consideration whatever to have
done. Did I not tell you the lady was an invalid? Oh!
Mr. Daly, Mr. Daly! I believe you are the d&mdash;&mdash;'</p>

<p>"'&mdash;&mdash;evil be, ma'am,' said I, interrupting her, 'to him
who evil thinks. I meant no harm, and&mdash;&mdash;'</p>

<p>"'You might have ruined me, sir,' said mine hostess.</p>

<p>"'Might I?' said I; 'when?'</p>

<p>"'This very night, sir,' said she; 'this very hour. Why,
what would have been thought of me and my house, if it had
been known that I had allowed you to sleep in that room?
Nobody would have believed that I did it out of pure regard
for your comfort, tired and knocked up as you were, and
because I had not a hole or corner besides into which you
could have poked yourself: however, it will be a lesson for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_437" id="Page_437">[437]</a></span>
me another time; and now, Mr. Daly, if you will take my
advice,&mdash;the lads are getting up in the yard,&mdash;you will let me
order out a chaise and pair, and go on to Guildford, where, I
have no doubt, they have plenty of beds, and where you may
get some comfortable rest; and as the brother of the lady in
No. 3 is sleeping here to-night, something unpleasant to all
parties might happen in the morning, and you would do me
a very great favour if you would go.'</p>

<p>"I felt considerably inclined, for many reasons, to accede
to what appeared the very reasonable desire of mine hostess:
first of all, I might do her a mischief by staying; in the
second place, the lady might complain to her brother; in the
third place, the White Hart at Guildford was a remarkably
good inn; and a well-made bed, and a well-warmed bed-room,
would be extremely comfortable by comparison with the
chilly atmosphere and the chair-slumber of the parlour
behind the bar at Ripley. To Guildford I must eventually
proceed,&mdash;and why not now? So, with the best possible
grace, I told mine hostess that I was at her command, and
begged of her to dispose of me as she thought fit.</p>

<p>"I paid her liberally for the horses, the repast, and the
portion of my night's rest which I ought to have had; and
when I stepped into the 'yellow and two,' I shook hands
with her, and she gave me a look as much as to say,
again and again, 'Daly, Daly! you are not to be
trusted.'</p>

<p>"Well, sir, away I went, glasses rattling, and wind
whistling (a short stage, you know); and, before four, we
reached the White Hart. I had forestalled my Guildford
sleep in the chaise; however, we soon made them hear at
the inn, and in less than three quarters of an hour I was
again rolled up in the sheets, having before I went to
bed written a note to my servant at Wrigglesworth, which
I desired might be sent off early in the morning, directing
him, after leaving word with Sir Marmaduke's man that I was
alive, if not merry, to come to me with my clothes and other<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_438" id="Page_438">[438]</a></span>
requisites for dressing by ten o'clock; and certainly, I must
say, I never did enjoy my rest and quietness so entirely and
completely as upon that particular occasion. Instead of ten
o'clock&mdash;having desired that I might not be disturbed&mdash;I did
not awake until past noon, and then regretted that my balmy
comfort had been broken in upon.</p>

<p>"From my servant, when I saw him, I learned that my
friends at Wrigglesworth had really expressed great anxiety
on my account, which did not displease me,&mdash;I rather like
to create an effect,&mdash;but I did not hear that my dear Lady
Wrigglesworth had either absented herself from dinner or
disappeared for the evening in consequence of my absence,
which I confess mortified my vanity a little. I dressed, and
having ensconced myself in the drawing-room of the White
Hart, the walls of which apartment were most constitutionally
decorated with loyal and orthodox prints, and which immediately
faces the Gothic House, I delighted myself by watching
the movements of two uncommonly pretty girls in the
said antiquated edifice, who appeared to be in full possession,
in the absence, as I surmised, of some greater, and probably
graver, personages.</p>

<p>"After breakfast I strolled out. I like Guildford: it is a
nice, clean, handsome, healthy town; the hill in the street I
admit to be a nuisance; the alternation between climbing up
and sliding down is tiresome, and even dangerous. These
little objections did not affect me&mdash;nothing affects me when
I am on the hunt for subjects&mdash;so away I went&mdash;smack
bang into a Quaker's shop to buy myself a pair of gloves&mdash;and
there&mdash;there I saw what I had never before seen&mdash;two
Quaker children playing about the place, thee'ing and thou'ing
each other with perfect French familiarity. Now, do <em>you</em>
know," continued Daly, "it is quite worthy of remark,&mdash;that
nobody&mdash;always, I presume, excepting Quakers themselves&mdash;has
ever seen a Quaker baby in arms, a Quaker lady
<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">enceinte</i>, or a Quaker gentleman with a <em>wooden</em> leg&mdash;eh? I
like these statistical speculations. So, having bought my<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_439" id="Page_439">[439]</a></span>
gloves, I returned to 'mine inn,' about one, intending forthwith
to proceed to Wrigglesworth.</p>

<p>"Just as I reached the door of the White Hart, and just
as my man was bringing out my horses, my eye was attracted
by a funeral procession, consisting merely of a hearse, one
mourning coach, and a private carriage, which had halted
before the door; two persons who had occupied the coach
having entered the house while fresh horses were put to the
three vehicles. A natural and not very blameable curiosity
prompted me to ask a jolly, merry-looking undertaker, whose
funeral it was, whither they were going, and whence they
had come?</p>

<p>"'Why, sir,' said the man, 'what you see here isn't
the regular job as I hopes to turn it out at Chichester next
Tuesday, which is the day fixed for the interment of the
corpse. Short notice, you see, sir; could not do everything
in a minute, sir.'</p>

<p>"'What is the name of the&mdash;&mdash;?' I hesitatingly asked.</p>

<p>"'Miss Barmingfield, sir,' said the man, 'is the name of
the corpse. Poor young lady, it was as well as you and me
three days ago, and was a coming down to Chichester to
spend a month with its mother; when, just in a minute, it
was taken ill at Ripley, and out it went for all the world like
the snuff of a candle.'</p>

<p>"'At Ripley!' said I; 'did she live at Ripley?'</p>

<p>"'No, sir, she didn't,' said the undertaker; 'you'll excuse
<em>me</em>&mdash;she died there.'</p>

<p>"'But she must have lived there first, I presume,' said I,
rather angrily; for a joker hates to be joked upon.</p>

<p>"'A very short time indeed,' said the jolly undertaker.
'She arrived at the Talbot the day before yesterday, about
twelve o'clock, in high health, and by six at night, as I said
afore, she was a corpse.'</p>

<p>"'At the Talbot!' said I. 'And are you bringing the
body from the Talbot now?'</p>

<p>"'Yes, sir,' said the man; 'on our way to Chichester.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_440" id="Page_440">[440]</a></span>
We could not move her, poor dear young lady, afore, because
I couldn't get things ready till this morning.'</p>

<p>"'Pray,' said I, with a degree of agitation which evidently
astonished my companion in the crape, 'where&mdash;in what
part of the Talbot at Ripley did the young lady die?'</p>

<p>"'In Number 3; that 'ere double-bedded room right over
the gateway,' said the man. 'We only packed her up this
morning.'</p>

<p>"My dear Gurney, you may easily imagine what my feelings
were. Only conceive the idea of having been turned
into a double-bedded room in the dark with a dead woman!
It was lucky that the horses were pronounced ready, and
that Major Barmingfield, whose residence at Ripley mine
hostess had so truly announced, made his appearance just
at the moment that the undertaker had enlightened me on
the subject. I felt a mingled sensation of horror at the
event, of joy at my escape from the place where it occurred,
and of repentance for my misconduct towards my landlady,
who had so good-naturedly strained a point for my accommodation,
which nearly overset me; and I have not a notion
what I should have done, had it not been that the coldness
of the weather afforded me an excuse for drinking off a glass
of brandy, and the lateness of the hour forced me to mount
my nag and begin my canter to Wrigglesworth forthwith."</p>


<hr class="r15" />
<h3>A VISIT TO THE OLD BAILEY.</h3>

<p>As I entered the Court, a case of some importance had
terminated, and the judge just concluded his summing up,
when the clerk of the arraigns put the customary question to
the jury, "How say ye, gentlemen&mdash;is the prisoner at the
bar guilty or not guilty?" Upon which the jurymen laid
their heads together, and I heard something in a whisper from
their foreman, who immediately pronounced the agreeable<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_441" id="Page_441">[441]</a></span>
verdict, "Not guilty." The prisoner bowed gracefully&mdash;he
was a pickpocket&mdash;and retired.</p>

<p>The prompt decision of the jury convinced me that it must
have been a clear case; and I rejoiced at the departure of the
now exonerated sufferer.</p>

<p>"That's a reg'lar rascal," said the sheriff to me in a whisper;
"never was such a case heard on, to be sure&mdash;seventeen
watches, thirty-two pocket handkerchiefs, four pair of spectacles,
and five snuff-boxes, all found upon his person!"</p>

<p>"Yet," said I, "the evidence could not have been very
strong against him&mdash;the jury acquitted him after a minute's
consultation."</p>

<p>"Evidence, Mr. Gurney!" said the sheriff, "how little do
you know of the Old Bailey!&mdash;why, if these London juries were
to wait to consider evidence, we never should get through the
business&mdash;the way we do here is to make a zig-zag of it."</p>

<p>I did not exactly comprehend the term as it was now applied,
although Daly had often used it in my society with
reference to a pin and a card universally employed at the
interesting game of <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">rouge et noir</i>; and I therefore made no
scruple of expressing my ignorance.</p>

<p>"Don't you understand, sir?" said the sheriff&mdash;"why, the
next prisoner will be found guilty&mdash;the last was acquitted&mdash;the
one after the next will be acquitted too&mdash;it comes alternate
like&mdash;save half, convict half&mdash;that's what we call a zig-zag;
and taking the haggregate, it comes to the same pint,
and I think justice is done as fair here as in any court in
Christendom."</p>

<p>This explanation rendered the next prisoner who made his
appearance an object of considerable interest to me. He was
a little dirty boy, who stood charged with having stolen a
pound of bacon and a peg-top from a boy somewhat his junior.
The young prosecutor produced a witness, who, as far as appearances
went, might, without any great injustice, have taken
the place of the prisoner, and who gave his evidence with considerable
fluency and flippancy. His manner attracted the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_442" id="Page_442">[442]</a></span>
notice of one of the leading barristers of the court, Mr. Flappertrap,
who, in cross-examining him, inquired whether he
knew the nature of an oath.</p>

<p>"Yes, I does," said the boy.</p>

<p>"Explain it," said Flappertrap.</p>

<p>"You may be d&mdash;&mdash;d," replied the lad; "that's a hoath,
arn't it?"</p>

<p>"What does he say?" said the judge&mdash;who, as I about
this period discovered, was as deaf as a post.</p>

<p>"He says, 'You may be d&mdash;&mdash;d,' my lord," said Flappertrap,
who appeared particularly glad of an opportunity to
borrow a phrase, which he might use for the occasion.</p>

<p>"What does he mean by that?" said the judge.
That is the way, my lord, he exhibits his knowledge of
the nature of an oath."</p>

<p>"Pah! pah!" said the judge&mdash;"Boy, d'ye hear me?"</p>

<p>"Yes," said the boy, "I hears."</p>

<p>"Have you ever been to school?"</p>

<p>"Yes," said the boy, "in St. Giles's parish for three
years."</p>

<p>"Do you know your catechism?"</p>

<p>The boy muttered something which was not audible to the
court generally, and was utterly lost upon the judge personally.</p>

<p>"What does he say?" said his lordship.</p>

<p>"Speak up, sir," said Mr. Flappertrap.</p>

<p>The boy muttered again, looking down and seeming embarrassed.</p>

<p>"Speak louder, sir," said another barrister, whose name I
did not know, but who was remarkable for a most unequivocal
obliquity of vision&mdash;"speak to his lordship&mdash;look at him&mdash;look
as I do, sir."</p>

<p>"I can't," said the boy, "you squints!"</p>

<p>A laugh followed this bit of <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">naïvete</i>, which greatly abashed
the counsellor, and somewhat puzzled the judge.</p>

<p>"What does he say?" said his lordship.</p>

<p>"He says he knows his catechism, my lord."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_443" id="Page_443">[443]</a></span></p>

<p>"Oh&mdash;does not know his catechism&mdash;why then, what&mdash;"</p>

<p>"<em>Does</em> know, my lord," whispered the lord mayor, who
was in the chair.</p>

<p>"Oh&mdash;ah&mdash;<em>does</em> know&mdash;I know&mdash;here, boy," said his
lordship, "you know your catechism, do you?"</p>

<p>"Yes," replied he, sullenly.</p>

<p>"We'll see, then&mdash;what is your name?" said his lordship.</p>

<p>"My name," said the intelligent lad&mdash;"what, in the catechism?"</p>

<p>"Yes, what is your name?"</p>

<p>"M. or N. as the case may be," said the boy.</p>

<p>"Go down, go down," said the judge, angrily, and down
he went.</p>

<p>"Gentlemen of the jury," said his lordship, "this case
will require very little of your attention&mdash;the only evidence
against the prisoner at the bar which goes to fasten the crime
upon him, is that which has been offered by the last witness,
who evidently is ignorant of the nature and obligation of an
oath. With respect to the pig's toes which the prisoner
stands charged with stealing&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"A peg-top, my lord!" said Flappertrap, standing up,
turning round, and speaking over the bench into the judge's
ears.</p>

<p>"Peg-top," said his lordship&mdash;"oh&mdash;ah&mdash;I see&mdash;very bad
pen&mdash;it looks in my notes like pig's toes. Well&mdash;peg-top&mdash;of
the peg-top which it is alleged he took from the prosecutor,
there has not been one syllable mentioned by the
prosecutor himself; nor do I see that the charge of taking
the bacon is by any means proved. There is no point for me
to direct your attention to, and you will say whether the prisoner
at the bar is guilty or not; and a very trumpery case
it is altogether, that I must admit."</p>

<p>His lordship ceased, and the jury again laid their heads
together; again the foreman gave the little "hem" of conscious
readiness for decision; again did the clerk of the
arraigns ask the important question, "How say ye, gentlemen,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_444" id="Page_444">[444]</a></span>
is the prisoner at the bar guilty or not guilty?" "Guilty,"
said the foreman to the clerk of the arraigns; and "I told
you so," said the sheriff to me.</p>

<p>The next case was a short one. The prisoner a woman,
the evidence clear and straightforward; but no great interest
was excited, because it was known that the case, for the
trial of which in point of fact the learned judge had, for
particular reasons, given his attendance, and which accounted
for his lordship's presence at the close of the session, was
very speedily to come on. This extraordinary combination
of circumstances afforded me the most favourable opportunity
of seeing all the sights of this half awful, half amusing scene,
even to the discharge of the grand jury, who had been
specially kept together for the purpose of finding or ignoring
the bill preferred against the eminent culprit, who was
evidently the great attraction of the day&mdash;having found
which, they had but three more to decide upon.</p>

<p>It was in the middle of the defence of the female prisoner,
now "<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">coram nobis</i>," and just as she was making a beautiful
but useless appeal to the "gentlemen of the jury," that a
bustle in the court announced some coming event.</p>

<p>"I am," said the weeping prisoner, "an orphan&mdash;I lost
my mother while I was yet a child&mdash;my father married
again, and I was driven from what had been before a happy
home&mdash;I have only to pray&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>Bang went a door&mdash;the scuffle of feet were heard&mdash;down
went some benches&mdash;"Make way&mdash;make way!" cried some
of the officers. "Stand back, sir, stand back&mdash;the gentlemen
of the grand jury are coming into court." To what the
moaning prisoner at the bar might have limited her supplications,
I never had an opportunity of ascertaining, for the
noise I have mentioned was succeeded by the appearance of
eighteen or nineteen men, dressed up in something like the
shabbiest dominoes I had seen at Lady Wolverhampton's
masquerade, trimmed with very dirty fur&mdash;the leader, or
foreman, carrying in his hand three bits of parchment. As<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_445" id="Page_445">[445]</a></span>
these gentlemen advanced to a space reserved for them in
the centre of the court, the judge kept exchanging bows
with them until they had all reached their destination&mdash;the
foreman then delivered to the clerk of arraigns the three
bits of parchment, who, putting his glasses on his nose,
read&mdash;James Hickson, larceny&mdash;not found.&mdash;John Hogg,
felony&mdash;true bill.&mdash;Mary Ann Hodges, felony&mdash;not found.
The clerk then informed his lordship, partly by words, and
partly by signs, the result of the deliberations of the grand
jury, and the fact that there were no more bills to set before
them. Having thus far proceeded, that officer inquired if
the gentlemen of the grand jury had any presentment to
make; whereupon the foreman, one of the largest and
dirtiest-looking persons imaginable, but whose countenance
was indicative of love of power and command, and who
appeared, at the moment he prepared himself to unburthen
his great soul of a grievance, to feel as if the whole world
were a football, made for him to play with,&mdash;</p>

<p>"My lord," said he, drawing himself up into an attitude,
"I am sure I need not, at this time of day, enter into any
discussion with your lordship on the vast importance of the
rights and privileges of Englishmen&mdash;of the original establishment
of the trial by jury in this country. It would be
worse than idle to occupy your valuable time and that of this
court, by dilating upon the merits of our constitution&mdash;the
chiefest of which has, I may say&mdash;been always&mdash;and I will
say&mdash;wisely, considerately, and prudently held to be that
peculiar mode of administering justice between man and
man. But, my lord, if in civil cases the deliberation and
decision of a jury are considered adequate safeguards to
the rights and property of the people, the law, still more
careful of their lives and liberties, has interposed in criminal
cases another and a higher tribunal, in the nature of a
grand jury." [Hereabouts the judge, having bowed his head
graciously, omitted to raise it again, having dropped into
a sound slumber.]</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_446" id="Page_446">[446]</a></span></p>

<p>"That tribunal of mediation in the first instance, is full of
importance; and whatever subsequent proceedings may be
taken in a case, I do say, for myself and my fellows, that
the decision upon <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">ex-parte</i> evidence requires more circumspection,
more care, and more consideration than a verdict
delivered after a case had been argued, and after witnesses
have been heard on both sides.</p>

<p>"If, my lord, your lordship concedes this point, I will
merely say, generally, that when the mind is occupied by
any important object, more especially in matters of jurisprudence,
it is absolutely necessary that nothing, if possible,
should occur to irritate or exacerbate the feelings&mdash;all should
be calm, and at rest."</p>

<p>Several people turned their eyes towards his lordship,
and some smiled.</p>

<p>"No incidental annoyance should be permitted to interpose
itself; nothing which could divert the judge from the
point to which his intellectual faculties ought to be directed,
and to which, my lord, under suitable circumstances, they
would as they should naturally converge. But, my lord, we
are finite beings&mdash;creatures of habit&mdash;subject to all the
weaknesses of our nature, and liable to be acted upon by
impulses almost unaccountable to ourselves. For myself
and my fellows, I may, perhaps, hope for a favourable interpretation
of our intentions, and a lenient judgment of our
conduct. We have, my lord, struggled hard to do our duty,
and I hope we have done it serviceably and effectually&mdash;conscientiously
and faithfully, I am sure we have. But, my
lord, we do think it necessary to call your lordship's most
serious attention to a fact which is embodied in the presentment
I hold in my hand. It is one which occurs to us to
be of paramount importance, as far as the tempering of
justice with mercy is involved: we have suffered grievously
from the existence of the evil to which we point; and although
at this time of the year its effects are of course
not so heavily felt as in the winter season, we have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_447" id="Page_447">[447]</a></span>
considered it a duty we owe to this court, to our fellow-countrymen,
and, we may say, to every man intimately
or remotely connected with the administration of criminal
justice, spread as they may be over the whole surface of
the globe, to state that the chimney in the grand jury-room
smokes so much and so continually, that it is impossible
to endure its effects calmly or patiently; and we
therefore think it right to bring the matter thus formally
before your lordship, and to desire that measures may be
taken to abate a nuisance which, by its effects, is calculated
to thwart, impede, and even distort the course of justice,
and produce evils, the magnitude of which it is scarcely
possible to imagine, and certainly not to express."</p>

<p>A buzz of approbation from the gentlemen of the grand
jury, who had been undergoing the process of smoke-drying
for several days, created a stir in the court, in the
midst of which the learned judge awoke; and the lord
mayor having whispered into his lordship's wig, his lordship
bowed, and the clerk took the parchment.</p>

<p>"Mr. Foreman, and gentlemen of the grand jury," said
his lordship, "I am happy to say that your labours for the
present are concluded; there are no more bills for your consideration.
Your presentment shall be attended to, and I
have to acknowledge your great zeal and attention, and to
give you thanks for your services:&mdash;gentlemen, you are now
discharged."</p>

<p>The bows, and scufflings, and cries of "Make way there
for the gentlemen of the grand jury, who are coming out of
court," were resumed, and the orator and his peers retired,
leaving the poor girl at the bar, wondering what had happened,
and what could be the reason that the worshipful
community with the cat-skin tippets should have interposed
themselves in the middle of her pathetic defence, in
order to discuss the irritating characteristic of a smoky
chimney.</p>

<p>I admit that the pompous oratory of the foreman, the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_448" id="Page_448">[448]</a></span>
"<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">mons parturiens</i>"&mdash;a splendid exhibition, and the "<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">ridiculus
mus</i>," which eventually presented itself, were to me
treats of no common order, and I regretted that Daly was
not with me to participate with me in devouring the grave
absurdities which we should have had before us.</p>

<p>The trial of the girl was concluded, and I had no doubt
as to her fate, now that I became acquainted with the principle,&mdash;she
was acquitted, and never shall I forget the effect
which this result of her trial produced upon her manners and
features. The moment my friend Zig-zag had pronounced
the words, "Not guilty," the pathetic expression which had
characterised her countenance turned into the most humorous,
and having winked her eye at the learned judge, who, poor
man, had summed up decidedly against her, she proceeded
to place her two hands extended in a right line from the tip
of her nose, in the direction of his lordship's seat, after the
fashion of what is called "taking a double sight," and then,
making a noise which, if not indescribable by imitation, is
certainly irreducible to writing, something between that which
a hackney-coachman utters to encourage his tired horses,
and that which a duck makes when it sees either a ditch or
a drake in dry weather, she turned herself suddenly round
with the least graceful pirouette I ever saw, leaving one of
the hands which she had previously elevated for observation
the last part of her person visible.</p>

<p>A short case of pot-stealing followed&mdash;the prisoner was
found guilty in ten minutes; and then came <em>the</em> case. It was
a curious and intricate one, and I felt quite assured, when I
saw the prisoner, a genteel-looking young man, take his place
under the inverted mirror, contrived with an almost diabolical
ingenuity, so as to refract and reflect the light upon
his face from the huge window at his back; I said to myself,
having got both hardened and hungry during my
short probation in court, "We shall not dine at six
to-day."</p>

<p>It might, perhaps, injure the feelings of the individual<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_449" id="Page_449">[449]</a></span>
himself, or, if he is dead, those of his friends and relations, to
detail the particular case, the more especially as nothing could
be clearer than that the crime laid to his charge was amply
and satisfactorily&mdash;to everybody except himself&mdash;proved and
substantiated.</p>

<p>Just as the last witness for the defence was under cross-examination,
I saw one of the lord mayor's servants put his
powdered head in a little hole, and whisper something to the
ordinary of Newgate, a remarkably pious-looking man, in full
canonicals, with a bag-wig, which, to use Foote's phraseology,
speaking of Dr. Simony (by whom, as of course everybody
knows, he meant the unfortunate Dr. Dodd), "looked as
white as a curd, and as close as a cauliflower." It struck me
that either the pretty wanton who had just been acquitted
desired some serious conversation with the clergyman, or
that the last convicted pot-stealer felt some qualms of conscience,
and had sent for spiritual assistance; but no,&mdash;my
friend Mr. Sheriff Bucklesbury relieved my mind from any
such apprehensions, by inviting me to a whisper, with an
expression of countenance which convinced me that it was
nothing of so serious a character which had suddenly summoned
the reverend divine from the court.</p>

<p>"Good news!" said the sheriff; "land is in sight."</p>

<p>"What?" said I, not exactly catching the idea.</p>

<p>"Dinner is not far distant," said the sheriff, "the ordinary
has been sent for to dress the salad."</p>

<p>Well, thought I, that ever a man so dressed, and so addressed,
as the reverend divine opposite, should quit the seat
of justice tempered with mercy, to mix oil and vinegar in a
salad-bowl, does seem strange. It was evident to <em>me</em>, from
the manner in which my friend spoke of the chaplain's secular
vocations, that his respect for the table was infinitely greater
than that which he entertained for the cloth, and never from
that day have I seen painted over suburban inns, "an ordinary
on Sundays at two o'clock," without thinking of
the reverend functionary so styled in the Old Bailey,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_450" id="Page_450">[450]</a></span>
and the probable duties he would be called upon to
perform.</p>

<p>The evidence having terminated, and the clock pointing to
fifteen minutes after six, his lordship began summing up. I
have already mentioned that his lordship was deaf, and the
strange blunders which I noticed in his early charges will perhaps
serve to inform the reader of these papers, whoever he
may be, that his lordship's handwriting was utterly unintelligible,
even to himself; indeed, so completely illegible were his
notes, that the only resource his lordship had, if ever they
were called for upon motions for new trials (which perhaps
I need not here add, was in his lordship's case by no means
an unfrequent occurrence), was to send them to be printed&mdash;printers
being proverbially the best decypherers in the
world.</p>

<p>His lordship's charge&mdash;barring the inevitable blunders and
hesitations, rendered absolutely necessary by this almost
hopeless illegibility&mdash;was exceedingly minute and elaborated.
He recapitulated the evidence of the three first witnesses
verbatim, and continued thus of the fourth:&mdash;</p>

<p>"Now, gentlemen of the jury, here is Amos Hardy&mdash;Handy&mdash;no,
not Handy&mdash;Harding&mdash;Amos Harding tells
you, that on Tuesday&mdash;no, not Tuesday&mdash;I see&mdash;Friday
the 14th&mdash;that is, the 24th&mdash;he was going along Liverpool&mdash;no&mdash;Liquorpond
Street&mdash;near Gug's Island&mdash;Guy's&mdash;no&mdash;Gray's
Inn Lane&mdash;yes&mdash;going along Liquorpond
Street, Gray's Inn Lane&mdash;at about eight o'clock in the
morning&mdash;and saw the fire break out of Mr. Stephenson's
windows. This, gentlemen of the jury, is a very remarkable
fact&mdash;and in connection with some other circumstances to
which we shall presently come, is quite worthy of your particular
attention&mdash;you perceive that he swears to eight o'clock
in the morning."</p>

<p>"Evening, my lord," said Mr. Flappertrap, standing up
and whispering his lordship audibly.</p>

<p>"Evening is it?" said his lordship&mdash;"ay, so it is&mdash;evening&mdash;no<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_451" id="Page_451">[451]</a></span>
matter&mdash;he swears to the time at which he
saw the fire break out&mdash;and hence will naturally arise in
your minds a chain of circumstances which it will be my duty
to endeavour to unravel. In the first place&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>Hereabouts one of the servants of the court put his head in
at one of the doors at the back of the bench, and whispered
the lord mayor much after the same manner in which Mr.
Flappertrap had just before whispered the judge. His lordship
immediately pulled out his watch&mdash;then looked at the
clock&mdash;and then wrote a few words upon a slip of paper, and
laid that slip of paper upon his lordship's notes. The judge
took up the memorandum, and tore it in pieces&mdash;as I thought
indignantly.</p>

<p>"You know what that means?" said my friend, the
sheriff.</p>

<p>"No," said I.</p>

<p>"Dinner's waiting," replied my friend&mdash;an announcement
which startled me, as it seemed impossible but that it would
be kept waiting for some time. This little scene, however,
was followed by the arrival of the recorder, who, after bowing
to the lord mayor, took his seat on the bench.</p>

<p>"I told you so," said the sheriff; "Mr. Recorder is come
to try the remaining cases&mdash;&mdash;" A cry of "Silence&mdash;pray,
silence," indicated that Mr. Sheriff Bucklesbury and I were
speaking somewhat too loudly.</p>

<p>"The circumstances to which I allude," continued his
lordship, after he had torn up the note, "are in fact so clearly
detailed in the evidence you have heard, that to men of intelligence
and experience, like those I am now addressing, any
attempt at explanation on my part would be superfluous.
The case appears a very clear one&mdash;you have to decide upon
the value of the evidence, and return your verdict accordingly,
giving the prisoner the benefit of any doubts you may entertain
on the question."</p>

<p>Never was I more surprised than at finding the promised
explanations and comparisons of fact and testimony so sud<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_452" id="Page_452">[452]</a></span>denly
cut short, after the manner of "the story of the Bear
and Fiddle," and I could not help, while the clerk of the
arraigns was putting his accustomed question to the jury,
noticing the circumstance to my worshipful friend.</p>

<p>"To be sure," said the sheriff, "don't you see&mdash;the time
is up&mdash;he smells the marrow puddings."</p>

<p>The jury, emulating the expedition of the judge, in one
minute, according to the zig-zag system, acquitted the
prisoner; whereupon, his lordship rising to depart, addressed
that individual in words to this effect:&mdash;</p>

<p>"Prisoner at the bar, you have been tried by an able,
patient, and conscientious jury of your countrymen, who,
convinced like myself of the enormity of your crime, and of
the wicked intentions by which you were actuated in its
commission, have returned the only verdict which they could
justly and honestly return&mdash;they have well discharged their
duty. And although it is not my province in this place to
pronounce the awful sentence of the law upon you, I shall
take care&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>Here Mr. Flappertrap whispered his lordship that the jury
had acquitted the prisoner.</p>

<p>"By-and-by, sir," said his lordship, angry at being
interrupted&mdash;"I shall take care, young man, that an example
shall be made in your person of the&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>The lord mayor here ventured to suggest that the "young
man" was found not guilty.</p>

<p>"Very well, my lord&mdash;presently, presently," said his
lordship&mdash;"even-handedness of justice; and that an enormous
offender of your class may not be suffered to escape
the just vengeance of the laws which he has outraged."</p>

<p>Here Mr. Flappertrap whipped a bit of paper over the
desk of the bench into the very place which the announcement
of dinner had so recently occupied. His lordship
looked at it, and exclaimed, unconsciously&mdash;"Oh! ah!&mdash;umph!"
and then continued&mdash;"It is true that upon the
present occasion the mercy and forbearance of the jury<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_453" id="Page_453">[453]</a></span>
have been exercised in a signal manner; and I trust their
benevolence and indulgence will not be thrown away upon
you. I maintain my own opinion still&mdash;yet they have
decided, and I have only to receive that decision&mdash;you are
discharged, sir, and may go about your business; but I can
tell you this, young man, you have had a very narrow
escape indeed."</p>

<p>There was not a man in court who did not tacitly admit
the truth and justice of at least the concluding passage of his
lordship's address to the acquitted prisoner; nor was that
individual himself the least astonished of his lordship's
auditors. The incident, however, was worthy of its place in
the day's proceedings, as producing a climax to the judicial
operations of the learned lord, and leaving upon the minds
of all his majesty's liege subjects then and there present, a
conviction, that however classical it maybe to picture Justice
blind, it is not, as a matter of convenience and utility, at all
desirable that she should also be deaf.</p>


<hr class="r15" />
<h3>THE TOOTHPICK-MAKERS' COMPANY.</h3>

<p>The day was extremely fine; the windows of the rooms
opening to the water, the house smelling of fried fish and
mud, and the little boys with naked legs screaming, "please
to make a scramble," we having attained this enviable
position in the building which looked like a race-stand, by
treading a labyrinth of the dirtiest alleys and stable-yards
that ever pauper or pony inhabited. It was, however, a
joyous scene; and Hull, who was good enough to be my
Mentor on the occasion, pooh-poohed the waiters into
allowing us to look at the dinner-room, all laid out for the
company; more than a hundred were expected, partitions
had been pulled down, holes cut out here, and props poked
in there, to afford the required accommodation; in short,
everything gave token of a goodly day.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_454" id="Page_454">[454]</a></span></p>

<p>Hull, who was at home everywhere, and everywhere
popular, appeared, as soon as he arrived, to supersede
everybody else.</p>

<p>"My dear friend," said he, "I happen to know these
people&mdash;the Toothpick Makers are one of the most ancient
corporations of the city. My dear sir, the Mercers were
incorporated in the 17th of Richard the Second&mdash;I have a
tract that will prove it&mdash;1393 they were embodied&mdash;I know
the clerk of the company at this day&mdash;so do you."</p>

<p>"No, I do not," said I.</p>

<p>"Pooh, pooh," said Hull, "don't tell <em>me</em>&mdash;Jemmy Hobbs&mdash;everybody
knows Jemmy Hobbs&mdash;married Miss Ball of
<ins class="corr" title="Transcriber's Note&mdash;Original text: 'Blackbeath'">Blackheath</ins>&mdash;'Splendid fellow, Jemmy. Well! these Mercers
are a fine company, so are the Grocers,&mdash;St. Anthony is
their patron. My dear sir, I am forced to know all these
things. Then there are the Drapers, and the Fishmongers&mdash;pooh,
pooh&mdash;Doctors, and Proctors, and Princes of the
Blood, are all fishmongers&mdash;Walworth was a fishmonger&mdash;eh&mdash;my
dear friend, you should see their paintings&mdash;splendid
things&mdash;Spiridiona Roma&mdash;fish in all seasons. Then there
are the Goldsmiths and the Skinners, and the Merchant
Tailors&mdash;Linen Armourers&mdash;eh&mdash;queer fellows, some of
them; but I do assure you&mdash;" (this was said in a whisper,)
"you will see some men here to-day worth seeing."</p>

<p>"I suppose," said I, "the Toothpick Makers' Company
was founded by Curius Dentatus&mdash;whence comes the French
<em>cure-dent</em>."</p>

<p>"Pooh, pooh," said Hull, "no such thing&mdash;much older
than Curius Dentatus&mdash;I happen to know&mdash;founded in the
reign of Edward the Fifth, my dear friend."</p>

<p>About this period the company began to arrive "thicker
and faster," and certainly I had never seen any one of them
before, which gave, at least, an air of novelty to the scene.
Generally speaking, they ran fat, and wore white waistcoats,
such as that to which I had likened the bow window of 77,
St. James's Street: they looked all very hot, and puffed a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_455" id="Page_455">[455]</a></span>
good deal;&mdash;however, they kept coming and coming, until
the drawing-room, as a sort of thing like a bad conservatory,
well placed to the south-west, was called, was so full that I
began to be as hot as my companions. Six o'clock arrived,
but no dinner; the master of the house (who, from wearing
a similar sort of uniform waistcoat, I took to be a Toothpick
Maker,) came in and spoke to some of the fattest persons of
the community, evidently intimating that the banquet was
ready&mdash;nevertheless no move was made, because it appeared
that Mr. Hicks had not arrived.</p>

<p>"You had better," said one of the more important persons
in the room, "let men be placed ready to see when Mr.
Hicks arrives at the end of the lane by the stables."</p>

<p>"Yes, sir," was the answer; and from that time I heard
nothing but Hicks and Mr. Hicks talked of, until I was
driven by extreme curiosity to inquire of my omniscient
friend Hull, who Mr. Hicks was.</p>

<p>"Hicks!" exclaimed Hull&mdash;"why, my dear friend, you
know Mr. Hicks&mdash;the great Mr. Hicks&mdash;everybody knows
Hicks."</p>

<p>"I for one," said I, "do not&mdash;" and it turned out that at
the moment I was not likely to be enlightened, for, just as
Hull was about to give me an account of this important
personage, a hubbub and bustle near the door, which speedily
pervaded the whole assembly, proclaimed his arrival. In a
moment the buzz of conversation ceased, a sort of circle was
made round Mr. Hicks, and several of the most distinguished
members of the community hurried up to take their places
near him. Hull dragged me towards this sanctum, this
magic ring, and, with a look of the greatest importance,
assured me, that it was right that I should immediately be
presented to Mr. Hicks. The presentation accordingly took
place, and no sooner was it over, than one of the grandees
came up to me, and, in a confidential whisper, informed me
that my place at dinner was on the left of Mr. Hicks, as
being a friend of the master. I concluded that the arrange<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_456" id="Page_456">[456]</a></span>ment
was attributable to Hull, who, I found, was to be my
neighbour on the left, and, although I could have dispensed
with the honour of so close an approximation to the hero
of the day, I rejoiced mightily that I was placed so near my
friend Hull, who would be as useful to me upon such an
occasion as is a catalogue of the pictures at an exhibition
anywhere else.</p>

<p>In a very short time dinner was announced, and Mr.
Hicks, having the master on his right hand, led the way to
the large room upstairs, round the whole of which the table
ran, exhibiting, as I entered the apartment, a lengthened line
of tin covers, looking like a collection of cuirasses, glittering
on the board;&mdash;the heat was tremendous, and the air redolent
with fried flounders. A few minutes sufficed to
arrange us, grace was said by the chaplain, and we fell to.
As in all similar cases, the exercise of eating and drinking
superseded conversation or remark, and I, who did but little
in that way myself, and having therefore an opportunity of
seeing the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">modus operandi</i> at my leisure, became suddenly
enlightened as to the extent to which such pleasures may be
carried. Of each and every dish did each and every man
partake, from turtle to white-bait, both inclusive; by comparison
with the individuals now before and around me, my
friend Bucklesbury, whom I had a week before considered a
prodigy in the way of feeding, sank into insignificance; to
the elaborated course of fish succeeded a host of fowls,
cutlets, hashes, stews, and other things of that nature,
accompanied by sundry haunches of venison, and succeeded
again by ducks innumerable, and peas immeasurable. The
destruction of all these articles was, however, effected with
ease in less than an hour and a half, during which the
attentions paid to Mr. Hicks were most marked and gratifying:
if the sun shone in upon the tip of his nose, the
waiters were ordered to pull down the blinds before him; if
the gentlest breeze wantoned about the back of his neck, the
master of the house was called to shut the window behind<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_457" id="Page_457">[457]</a></span>
him; for <em>him</em> the chairman culled the choicest bits; to <em>him</em>
the landlord tendered his most particular wines: every eye
was fixed on <em>his</em> actions, every ear seemed open to <em>his</em> words;
he had, however, as yet spoken little, but had "eaten the
more."</p>

<p>All sublunary pleasures must have an end, so had this
dinner; and a call of silence, and the thumping of the president's
hammer upon the table, announced that some professional
gentlemen were about to sing <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Non nobis, Domine</i>.
They began&mdash;we all standing up&mdash;I with the sun full in my
eyes, setting over London in all its glory. The voices harmonised
beautifully; but fine and melodious as they were, I
felt that the canon, or whatever it is called, very much
resembled a fire which, smouldering and smouldering in the
low notes, kept perpetually bursting out in a fresh place,
when one fancied it out. As far as the religious feeling of
the thing goes, it was misplaced; and as for its duration, it
seemed to be more like three graces than one.</p>

<p>This over, the wine began to pass, and "beards to wag;"
Hicks grew condescending, and the day began to mend; the
King's health was given&mdash;song, God save the King&mdash;chorus
by the company, all standing&mdash;The Queen&mdash;The Prince of
Wales&mdash;then the Duke of York and the Army&mdash;the Duke of
Clarence and the Navy&mdash;the Memory of St. Ursula, the
mother of all Toothpick Makers, with an appropriate glee,
received with loud cheers.</p>

<p>The Master then rose and begged to propose a toast. No
sooner had he uttered these words, than the whole room rang
with applause, the wine-glasses danced hornpipes upon the
table to the music of the forks and spoons, and the noise was
tremendous. "I see," continued the worthy president,
"that you anticipate my intentions; gentlemen, there could
be no doubt upon your minds what the toast would be"
(more cheering). "I will not occupy your time, nor hinder
you from the gratification of your feelings upon this topic by
dilating upon the merits of the illustrious individual whose<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_458" id="Page_458">[458]</a></span>
health I am about to propose; whether we regard him in
public life, guiding by his zeal and energy the community
which he fosters and protects by his influence, or view him
in private society, the ornament of the circle of which he is
the centre, our gratitude and admiration are equally excited.
Gentlemen, I will not trespass upon your time, or wound,
what I know to be the delicacy of his feelings, by recapitulating
the deeds which gild his name, and which have, during
the last year, added so much to his honour and reputation,
and to the welfare and comfort of his colleagues and associates:&mdash;I
beg to propose the health of Benjamin Spooner
Hicks, Esq.,&mdash;a name dear to every Englishman&mdash;with all
the honours."</p>

<p>Then came a storm of applause unparalleled, at least in
my experience. A band of music, which had hitherto been
silent, struck up "See the Conquering Hero comes," and
nine times nine cheers were given in a style the most overwhelming.
During this storm of rapture, I seized the
opportunity of once again asking Hull who Hicks was, and
what he had done, to deserve and receive all these extraordinary
marks of approbation and applause, but all I could
extract from my rubicund friend was, "Pooh, pooh,&mdash;don't
tell me&mdash;you know Hicks&mdash;my dear friend, everybody knows
Hicks&mdash;there isn't a man better known in the universe."
There was no time amidst the din of glory to assure him once
more that I had by no possible accident ever heard his name
before, so I resumed my seat, as the object of our enthusiasm
quitted his, to return thanks. His up-rising was hailed by
the company with an almost Persic adoration:&mdash;silence at
length having been obtained, he spake&mdash;</p>

<p>"Sir, and Gentlemen,&mdash;There are certain periods in our
existence which entirely defy description&mdash;this, as far as I
am concerned, is one of them. I have been placed in many
trying situations, and I think I may say, without fear of
contradiction, I have behaved as became a man (loud cheers);
I am aware that some of my efforts for the benefit of my<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_459" id="Page_459">[459]</a></span>
fellow-creatures have been crowned with success (hear, hear,
hear); and I am thankful to Providence that I am possessed
of the means to do good to them as is not so well off as myself
(loud cheers). I say, sir, it would be the height of
baseness for a man who has been born with a silver spoon in
his mouth, not now and then to take it out, and feed them as
has not been so fortunate (great cheering). My political
feelings and principles I need not touch upon (immense
cheering); they are known to all the world (tumultuous
applause); I shall steadily maintain the course I have heretofore
followed, and observe the straight line, neither swerving
to the right, nor to the left, as little awed by the frown of
power as flattered by its smiles (hear, hear, hear).</p>

<p>"Gentlemen, I sincerely thank you for the honour you
have done me, and beg to drink all your good healths in
return."</p>

<p>The shoutings were here renewed, but to an extent far
beyond the former exhibition. Mr. Hicks sat down, but
still the thunder continued; and scarcely had it subsided,
even for a moment, when Mr. Hicks, upon his legs again,
caused a relapse which nearly drove me mad.</p>

<p>Hicks waved his hand, and it was a calm&mdash;you might
have heard a pin drop&mdash;he had to propose the health of the
worshipful chairman, the Master of the Toothpick Makers'
Company.</p>

<p>After expressing in almost the same words that Hicks had
just before used, his conviction that this was the "proudest
moment of his life," the chairman continued to observe, that
if anything could possibly add to the gratification of having
his health drunk by such an assembly, it was the fact of its
having been proposed by such an individual. He then proceeded
to say, that he was quite sure in that society, composed
as it was of men of all parties, all professions, and all
politics, he need not expatiate upon the merits of the honourable
gentleman to whom he had previously alluded&mdash;they
were known all over the world. <em>He</em>, like Hicks, returned<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_460" id="Page_460">[460]</a></span>
the most heartfelt acknowledgments for the favour he had
received at their hands, and sat down amidst very loud
acclamations.</p>

<p>Still I was left in ignorance of all the great deeds which
"gilt" my friend Hicks's "humble name;" and I found,
being so near him, that it was quite impossible to get enlightenment.
At length, however, I was destined to hear something
of the character of his achievements; for shortly after
the worshipful master had sat down, and just before the
healths of the wardens of the Toothpicks, or some such
functionaries, were about to be toasted, a tall, thin, pale man&mdash;a
rare specimen in the Museum&mdash;rose and said, as nearly
as I can recollect, what follows:&mdash;</p>

<p>"Sir, I am sure you will forgive me for the intrusion I
now venture upon; but I cannot permit this opportunity to
pass without expressing, on my own part and on the behalf
of several of my worthy neighbours, a sense of our obligation&mdash;and,
indeed, the sense of obligation under which, like us,
the rest of civilised Europe, are laid, by the manly, courageous,
zealous, and indefatigable exertions of the honourable gentleman
on the right of the chair, to whom you have so justly
referred (loud cheers). It may, perhaps, be thought superfluous
in me to enlarge upon a subject so familiar to your
hearts; but I cannot avoid mentioning a trait which at once
displays the greatness of that honourable gentleman's mind,
the prowess of his courage, and his immutable determination
to do justice to all men"&mdash;(still louder cheers followed this
point).</p>

<p>"I think," continued the pale man, "I need not speak
more distinctly upon the subject to which I allude." (Here
shouts rent the room, and glasses began to dance again.)
"But, lest there should be any gentleman present, who
might by accident be unacquainted with the circumstance
to which I refer"&mdash;(cries of "no, no! impossible! hear,
hear! order, order!") "I say, <em>if</em>&mdash;for it may be so&mdash;if
such a thing should be, I think it best at once to explain,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_461" id="Page_461">[461]</a></span>
that the conduct to which I now specifically refer, but which
I may truly say is of a piece with every action of his honoured
life, is that which our great benefactor&mdash;and friend&mdash;if he
will allow me so to call him"&mdash;(Hicks nodded, and said
"hear!")&mdash;"observed upon the occasion of removing the
lamp from the corner of Black Lion Street to the head of
Spittle Court." (Immense cheering.) "Sir, I do not wish
to go into the question of the eleven yards of pavement from
the Swan Inn to the bootmaker's"&mdash;(roars of laughter burst
from part of the company, as the evident severity of this
remark upon the conduct of some other eminent individual,
murmurs from others, "hear, hear!" from many, and "oh,
oh!" from a few!) "I strictly confine myself to the lamp;
and I do say, without fear of contradiction, that the benefit
conferred on society by that change, and the manly way in
which it was effected, without truckling to the higher powers,
or compromising the character and dignity of the Company,
has shed immortal lustre upon the name and fame of the
honourable gentleman to whom I have alluded. (Immense
cheers.) I have to apologize for this effusion"&mdash;("no, no!
bravo") "but it is involuntary. I have for several months
laboured under emotions of no ordinary nature; I have now
unburdened my mind, and have done my duty to myself, my
honourable friend, and my country."</p>

<p>The ogre sat down amidst the loudest possible applause,
and more shouts were sent forth in honour of Hicks.</p>

<p>The healths of the Wardens of the Company were then
drunk&mdash;<em>they</em> returned thanks:&mdash;then came alternately songs
and glees by the professional gentlemen:&mdash;then they drank
Mrs. Hicks and family;&mdash;and then&mdash;for be it observed, the
fervour of the applause increased as the night grew older&mdash;the
uproar was tremendous. Nine times nine seemed infinitely
too small a complement of cheers to compliment the Hickses,
and I had become dead tired of the whole affair, when Mr.
Hicks&mdash;the great Mr. Hicks&mdash;rose to return thanks for
<em>that</em> honour. He talked of connubial felicity, and spoke of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_462" id="Page_462">[462]</a></span>
the peculiar merits and charms of his daughters with all the
eloquence of a tuft-hunting mother. Having done which,
he fell to moralising upon the lateness of the hour, and the
necessity of recollecting that Greenwich was nearly five
miles from town; that, happy as we were, prudence pointed
to a period at which such enchantments should terminate.
"Gentlemen," said he, "in conclusion, I have obtained
permission to propose one parting bumper. I believe we
are all agreed that the constitution of England is a blessing
envied by every country in the world&mdash;(loud cheers). We
have drank the king, the queen, the royal family, the army,
the navy, the ministers, and indeed everything that we
could be well supposed to drink constitutionally. Gentlemen,
the place in which we are now assembled suggests to me
the best, the most loyal, the most appropriate, and the most
constitutional toast possible as a conclusion. I give it you
with feelings of mingled loyalty and piety&mdash;I propose to
you, 'The Crown and Sceptre,' and may they never be
separated."</p>

<p>This unqualified piece of nonsense, delivered seriously by
Hicks (rather overcome) to about fifty or sixty survivors of
the original dinner, nearly killed me with laughing: not so
the company&mdash;at it they went&mdash;cheered like mad&mdash;up-standing
nine times nine&mdash;rattle went the forks&mdash;jingle and smash
went the glasses&mdash;and, in the midst of the uproar, Hicks
rose, the Master did the same, and, of course, we followed
the example.</p>

<p>Then came all the worry and confusion about carriages&mdash;the
little alley was crowded with people seeking for conveyances&mdash;it
had just begun to rain. Hull looked at <em>me</em>,
and inquired what vehicle I had?&mdash;I had none&mdash;I was
annihilated&mdash;when, judge my delight and surprise at finding
the illustrious Hicks himself at my side, offering Hull and
myself places in his coach. I could scarcely believe it;
however, so it was, and an advantage was derivable from it
for which I was scarcely prepared.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_463" id="Page_463">[463]</a></span></p>

<p>"Come down with <em>me</em>," said Hicks, "directly:&mdash;this way&mdash;they
are preparing a deputation to light me through the
alley to the carriage&mdash;I want to avoid it. My boy tells me
it is all ready&mdash;if we can but get round the corner, we shall
be off without being observed&mdash;they <em>will</em> do these things, but
<em>incog.</em> for me&mdash;I hate state and finery&mdash;eh, Mr. Hull?"</p>

<p>"Pooh, pooh!" said Hull, "<em>you</em> need no new honours&mdash;to
be sure&mdash;what a day&mdash;eh&mdash;never was any thing so
splendid!"</p>

<p>And so Hicks's boy, or, as Hull called him, "b'y," preceding,
we made our escape into the patriot's carriage;
and never did I more rejoice in my life. The quiet of
the calm which aeronauts experience when they rise in a
few minutes from the tumultuous shoutings of the populace
into the dead stillness of the vast expanse above, cannot
be more surprising than was the tranquillity of the coach
compared with the boisterousness of the company.</p>

<p>Mr. Hicks carried us as far as he could, without inconveniencing
himself, and set us down at the corner of a small
street in Cheapside, having, just before we parted, mentioned
to me that if at any time I should be in need of any article
in the hardware line, I should find every thing he had at
wholesale prices and of the very best quality.</p>

<p>Hull and I walked westward, but whether it arose from
the length of the way or its width, I cannot exactly state, I
was uncommonly tired when I reached home. When I fell
asleep, which I did as soon as I got into bed, I dreamed of
the extraordinary infatuation which possesses men in all
classes of life to believe themselves eminently important,
and their affairs seriously interesting to all the rest of the
world; and became perfectly satisfied that every sphere
and circle of society possesses its Hicks, and that my friend
the hardwareman was not one bit a greater fool than his
neighbours.</p>

<h3>THE MANSERVANT'S LETTER.<a name="FNanchor_64" id="FNanchor_64"></a><a href="#Footnote_64" class="fnanchor">[64]</a></h3>

<p class="right small">Murrel Green, Thursday.</p>

<p>"<span class="smcap">Dear Sarah</span>,&mdash;I should not wonder if you wasn't a little
surprised at neither seeing nor hearing from me before this,
as I calculate you also will be at reading the date of this
hepistol. The truth is, that the Captain, whose stay in
England will be very short, says to me, just as I was
coming off to you the night after I wrote, 'Lazenby,'
says he, 'where do you go when you leave me?' So I
contumaciously expressed myself in these identical words,
'Why, sir,' says I in a masculine manner, 'I am going to
Blissford.' Whereupon he observed to me that he supposed
I had got what the French calls a <em>chair ah me</em> there, and
that I was likely to settle myself in the neighbourhood&mdash;so
then I expostulated with him and mentioned my notion of
setting up in the general line, and he laughed and said that
he hoped to do that himself some day, and was quite
factious upon the toepick, which after his manner the night
before, rather constaminated me, as Goldfinch says in Ben
Jonson's 'Beggars' Opera;' whereupon he; says, looking
at me in his droll way, 'Tom,' says he, 'I shan't be
long in London; hadn't you better go up with me and
Mrs. M. when we are married, and stop with us till we
go?'&mdash;for, mind you, he is going to take her out with
him to share the toils of the champaign; and this was the
very first of his directly insinuating that the thing was all
settled: so I hesitates a little; and thinking of you, my dear
Sarah, I says, says I, 'Sir, will you give me an hour to
preponderate?'&mdash;'To be sure I will,' says the Captain.
Well, I begins to think; and I calculated I might make a
few pounds by stopping and paying his bills and managing
his luggage, and all <em>that</em>, before he went. So I says to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_465" id="Page_465">[465]</a></span>
Susan&mdash;she as I wrote about in my last&mdash;'If you was <em>me</em>,'
says I, 'what would you do in this conundrum?'&mdash;'Why,'
says Susan, 'if you ask me <em>my</em> advice, if I was <em>you</em> I'd
stay and go with the Captain.' So I considers a bit more;
and I says to her, 'I don't much like missus as is to be.'&mdash;'Nor
I,' said Susan, 'although I have knowed her longer
than you; but for all <em>that</em>, I'm going as her maid; only to
stay till they leave England for good.'&mdash;'Why,' says I,
having heard her opinion of the future Mrs. Merman, and
how Mrs. Gibson had gone away entirely excavated by the
levity of her mistresse's behaviour, 'I had no notion you
would do such a thing.'</p>

<p>"So Susan says to me, 'Lazenby,' says she&mdash;she calls
me Lazenby, for we are quite like brother and sister now&mdash;'my
old missus wishes it; and she hints something about
remembering me hereafter; and so what is it?' says Susan;
'in these days, folks don't stick at trifles; and sure if Miss
Millicent is good enough to be Captain Merman's wife, she
is good enough to be my missus.' That seemed remarkably
judicial to my comprension; and so, thinking what was
good for Susan could not be interogatory to me, up I goes
to the Captain, and agrees to stay with him, as I tell you,
till he bids a Jew to his native land, at which perriod, dear
Sarah, I hope to return to you, like the good bee who, as
Pope says in 'The Deserted Village'&mdash;</p>

<p class="noindent">and bring you an affectionate art, and I should say upwards
of seven pounds fourteen shillings in hard cash by way of
hunney. Susan says she should like to know you, she is so
much indisposed towards you by my inscription of you; and
I should like you to be friends, which perhaps may be some
of these days, if she comes back to that part of the country.
She would be uncommon nice company for both of us, she
is so candied and filantropical, and it is a great thing for
a married couple to have such a friend.</p>

<p>"I don't know whether you have ever been in this quarter
of the world, although, as I don't think you could well
have got to Blissford by any other road from London,
pr'aps you have; it is very wild and romantic, with a bit
of a green before the door, upon which there are geese,
ducks, enseterar; and Susan and I am going to take a walk,
and we shall carry this letter ourselves to Artley Row, where
is the Post-office, because, as I have promised the Captain
not to say anything one way or the other, I thought if he
saw a letter redressed to the Passonage, he might inspect
something; so Susan and I agreed it would be better to
go out in the dusk as if miscellaneously, and slip it in
unbeknown to any body, while master and missus is enjoying
their <em>teat a teat</em> after dinner. We go on to the
meterpolis in the morning, and Susan and I go outside in the
rumble-tumble, for Miss Pennefather has lent us the charriot,
which I suppose I shall have to bring back, which, as I
cannot do without horses, will be a very pretty incursion.
I don't in course know how long the Captain will be before
he goes, so do not fret. I have got your wach, which
does not keep tim well, but I never look at it without
thinking of you. Susan says it wants to have new hands
put to it, and I shall give it to a watchmaker in town to
riggle at it spontaneously on my arrival. The Captain and
his mate seem very happy, which also makes me think of
you, Sarah dear; she certainly is no beauty to my taste;
she is a good deal in the Ottomy line, and I should say
not easily pleased; but in course as yet it all goes uncommon
comfortable; for, as O'Keefe says in his comical
farce of 'Love for Love:'&mdash;</p>

<p>"I hope poor Miss Fanny don't take on about the loss
of master; I'm sure if I was she, and knew that he left me
for the sake of Malooney's money, I should care no more<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_467" id="Page_467">[467]</a></span>
about him than nothing at all&mdash;true love loves for itself
a loan&mdash;don't it, dear Sarah? Oh, Sarah! Susan and I had
some hot sassages and mashed potatoes for dinner to-day,
and I did so think of you, and I said so; and Susan says
to me, says she, 'Does your Sarah love sassages?' so I
said, says I, 'Yes, where's the girl of taste as doesn't?'&mdash;and
so she says again, 'Then I wish she was here'&mdash;and
we both laughed like bogies. So <em>that</em> shows we don't
forget you.</p>

<p>"As to Miss Fanny, there is one thing&mdash;which, if you
have an opportunity upon the sly, you may incoherently
hint&mdash;which may be p'rhaps a considerable revelation of her
despondency, if she still cares for master; which is this&mdash;the
officer which is to have the recruiting party in place of
him, as Rattan told me before I came away, is taller and
better-looking than master, and quite the gentleman: p'raps,
if you tell Miss Fanny that, it will controvert her regret,
and make her easy&mdash;I know enough of the seck, Sarah, to
know that it is with females as it is with fighters&mdash;to use the
words of Young in his 'Abelard and Eloisa,'&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<p class="verse">One down, t'other come on.</p>
</div></div></div>

<p>"And so perhaps Miss Fanny may make up her mind to
the gentleman which will relieve my master&mdash;I am sure I
hope she may, for she is I am sure constipated to make any
man happy in that way. Well, Sarah dear, I must now
say good-bye&mdash;or else, Tim flies so fast, Susan and I may
be mist. I haven't room to tell you all about Master's wedding,
which was all done with as little ceremony as possible,
and as Susan says there was not a minnit to be lost, but I
will explain all particulars when I come back to you, which
will not be long first. So squeeze my keeping you in expence
for these few days, for I was so busy I could not write
before, but Susan says she is sure you will forgive me, and
so I think you will.</p>

<p>"I say, dear Sarah, in exclusion, I hope that you have not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_468" id="Page_468">[468]</a></span>
been speaking to William Waggle, the baker's young youth,
because, as I am absent, it might give some grounds for
calomel&mdash;Mrs. Hodgson and those two Spinkeses her sisters
is always a-watching&mdash;I'm not a bit jellies myself&mdash;no, I
scorn the 'green hided malster,' as Morton says in his
'New Way to pay old Debts'&mdash;but I know the world&mdash;I
know what the old Tabbies say, and how they skirtinize
every individil thing which relates to us&mdash;as I says to Susan&mdash;the
eyes of the hole world is on us two&mdash;you and me&mdash;and
therefore, Sarah dear, mind what you do, and do not
encourage any of them to walk with you in an evening&mdash;specially
Bill, inasmuch as the whiteness of his jacket would
make the round-counter the more evident to the Hargooses
of the place.</p>

<p>"A jew Sarah&mdash;the next you will hear from me will be in
London&mdash;most probably at the Whiteoss Cellar in Pickadilly,
or the Golden Cross, Charing Cross, which the Captain
thinks the quietest spots to fix upon&mdash;rely upon my righting
you the minute I have time&mdash;I told Rattan that I was going
back to Blissford, so he will have had no message for you;
besides, I don't want you to have any miliary connexions
during my abstinence&mdash;therefore please to remember me in
your art, as I do you in mine, and if you will, do me the
fever to pay Mrs. Jukes three and ninepence which I owe
her for washing my things, which I will repay you when
we meet&mdash;best love, in which Susan, though she does not
know you, joins with equal sincerity&mdash;take care of yourself,

<h3>THE BIBLIOMANIAC.</h3>

<p>"Here," said he, drawing from one of his pockets a very
small dirty black-letter book, "this is all I shall do to-day&mdash;my<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_469" id="Page_469">[469]</a></span>
pursuit, you know&mdash;eh&mdash;old books&mdash;rare books&mdash;I don't
care what I give so as I can secure them&mdash;this is a tract
of 1486&mdash;seventeen pages originally&mdash;five only wanting&mdash;two
damaged&mdash;got it for seventy-two pounds ten shillings&mdash;Caxton&mdash;only
one other copy extant&mdash;that in the British
Museum."</p>

<p>"Seventy-two pounds for <em>that</em>!" said I.</p>

<p>"To be sure," replied Hull; "why, my dear sir, it is not
worth <em>my</em> while to come out of the city unless I spend
seventy or eighty pounds in the morning&mdash;I cannot afford
the time for less."</p>

<p>"And what is it about?" said I, innocently.</p>

<p>"Why, I do <em>not</em> happen to know <em>that</em>," said Hull; "it is
an essay, I believe, to prove that Edward the Fourth never
had the toothache; but it is, as you see, in Latin, and I
don't read Latin."</p>

<p>"Then why buy it?" said I.</p>

<p>"Buy!" exclaimed he, looking at me through his glass
with an expression of astonishment&mdash;"I buy thousands of
books!&mdash;pooh, pooh! millions, my dear sir, in the course of
a year, but I never think of reading them&mdash;my dear friend, I
have no time to read."</p>

<p>I confess I did not exactly comprehend the character of
the bibliomania, which appeared to engross my friend, nor
the particular gratification which the purchase of the unreadable
works seemed to afford him. But he only curled
up his mouth, as much as to say that I was a dunce, and
that there was a sort of delight&mdash;felt in common with
magpies, I presume&mdash;of picking up objects and hiding them
away in dark holes and corners.&mdash;<cite>Gilbert Gurney.</cite></p>


<hr class="r15" />
<h3>ABSENCE OF MIND.</h3>

<p>Absence of mind may be defined to be a slowness of mind,
in speaking or in action. The absent man is one who, when<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_470" id="Page_470">[470]</a></span>
he is reckoning up a bill, and hath collected the particulars,
will ask a by-stander what the amount is. When he is
engaged in a law-suit, and the day of trial comes, he forgets
it, and goes into the country. He goes to the theatre to
see the play, and is left behind, asleep upon the benches.
He takes any article, and puts it away securely; then he
begins to look for it, and is never able to find it. If a
man comes and tells him of the death of a friend, and asks
him to the funeral, he says, with a melancholy countenance,
and tears in his eyes, "What uncommon good luck!"
When he receives money, he calls men to witness the
transaction; when he pays a debt, he does not. He
quarrels with his servant for not bringing him cucumbers
in winter; and forces his children to run and wrestle for
their health, till they are ready to die of fatigue. When
in the country, he dresses his dinner of herbs, he salts
them until they are unfit to eat. And if anybody ask him,
"How many dead have been carried through the sacred
gate, to be buried?" he answers, "I wish to my heart you
and I had half as many."</p>


<hr class="r15" />
<h3>A DISTINGUISHED TRAVELLER.</h3>

<p>Lady Cramly was, or rather had been during her husband's
lifetime, the authoress of a solitary work, upon the
memory of which she still lived and revelled. She had
published two volumes of travels. In some of the countries
which she described she really <em>had</em> been, but in others
certainly not; but wherever the scene was laid, Lady
Cramly and Seraphine were at the top of the tree. Princes
were proud to hand them to their carriage&mdash;crowned heads
opened their palaces to receive them&mdash;Lady Cramly received
medals, orders, and decorations, which never before had
been conferred upon females. Seraphine&mdash;with a pug nose,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_471" id="Page_471">[471]</a></span>
low forehead, and high shoulders&mdash;had been painted by all
the first artists, and modelled by all the first sculptors on
the Continent. The book of travels had gone through eleven
editions&mdash;Mr. Liberal, the eminent publisher, had made six
thousand pounds by it, and would have made more, only
that he had foolishly insisted, out of respect to the character
of her particular friend the Pope, upon expunging the
authoress's account of her having waltzed with his Holiness
at a masquerade during the carnival, to which he went only
to have the pleasure of being her partner. Upon this
circumstance, and her having been made a Burgher (or
rather Burgheress) at Bruges (the only instance of the honour
ever having been bestowed upon a lady), she not unfrequently
descanted, and so often had she told the histories amongst
others, that all who heard them, including Seraphine herself,
felt certain, that if nobody else believed them, Lady Cramly
did.</p>

<p>It was of Lady Cramly the wag said that her authority
ought never to be doubted, for she must always be <em>re-lied</em>
upon. Nevertheless, her poetical prose was very amusing,
and upon Waller's principle (we presume) she was certainly
an extremely eloquent and entertaining companion.</p>

<h3>DALY'S PRACTICAL JOKES<a name="FNanchor_65" id="FNanchor_65"></a><a href="#Footnote_65" class="fnanchor">[65]</a></h3>

<p>Among the group was a man whose name was Daly&mdash;who,
of all the people accounted sane and permitted to range the
world keeperless, I hold to have been the most decidedly
mad. His conversation was full of droll conceits, mixed
with a considerable degree of superior talent, and the
strongest evidence of general acquirements and accomplishments.
He appeared to be on terms of familiar intimacy
with all the members of our little community, and, by his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_472" id="Page_472">[472]</a></span>
observations and anecdotes, equally well known to persons of
much higher consideration; but his description of himself to
<em>me</em>, shortly after our introduction, savoured so very strongly
of insanity&mdash;peculiar in its character, I admit&mdash;that I almost
repented having, previously to hearing his autobiography, consented
to send on my horses to Teddington, in order to
accompany him to that village after the departure of the rest
of the party to London, in a boat in which he proposed to
row himself up to Hampton Court, where, it appeared, he
had, a few days before, fixed his temporary residence.</p>

<p>"I hope," said he, "that we shall be better acquainted.
I daresay you think me an odd fish&mdash;I know I <em>am</em> one. My
father, who is no more, was a most respectable man in his
way&mdash;a sugar-baker in St. Mary Axe. I was destined to
follow in his wake and succeed to the business; however, I
cut the treacle tubs at an early age&mdash;I saw no fun in firkins,
and could not manage conviviality in canvas sleeves. D'ye
ever read the <cite>London Gazette</cite>?"</p>

<p>"Sometimes," said I.</p>

<p>"In that interesting paper," said Daly, "I used to look
twice a week to see the price of Muscovados. One hapless
Saturday I saw my father's name along with the crush: the
affair was done&mdash;settled; dad went through the usual ceremony,
and came out of Guildhall as white as one of his
own superfine lumps. Refreshed by his ruin, my exemplary
parent soon afterwards bought a house in Berkeley Square,
stood a contest for a county, and died rather richer than he
started."</p>

<p>"And you, I suppose, his heir?" said I.</p>

<p>"He had not much to leave," replied my new friend.
"He ran it rather fine towards the close of his career. My
two sisters got their fortunes paid, but I came off with what
we technically called the scrapings&mdash;four hundred a year,
sir, is the whole of my income; all my personal property I
carry under my hat. Timber I have none&mdash;save my walking-stick;
and as to land, except the mould in three geranium<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_473" id="Page_473">[473]</a></span>
pots, which stand in my sitting-room window, I haven't an
inch. Still, Mr. Gurney, although I have not a ducat in my
purse,</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<p class="verse">'Yet I'm in love, and pleased with ruin.'"</p>
</div></div></div>

<p>"I envy your philosophy and spirits," said I.</p>

<p>"You are right," replied Daly; "fun is to me what ale
was to Boniface; I sleep upon fun&mdash;I drink for fun&mdash;I talk
for fun&mdash;I live for fun; hence my addiction to our dear funny
friends of to-day. They just suit me&mdash;they do nothing but
laugh; they laugh <em>with</em> one when present, and <em>at</em> one when
absent&mdash;but to me that is the fun."</p>

<p>I immediately thought of the "funny" observations upon
myself, which I had overheard earlier in the day, pretty well
assured that the voice of my new laughter-loving acquaintance
had not been the least loud in the debate.</p>

<p>"I admit myself fond of practical joking," continued my
friend. "I don't mean in one's own particular circle&mdash;there
it is dangerous; people are not always in the same humour&mdash;what
they think uncommonly good fun one day, they will
seriously resent as an insult the next. There's no judging
with certainty a man's temper of mind, and it is not easy to
ascertain how much melted butter a gentleman would like to
have poured into his coat-pocket without kicking; I avoid
that sort of thing, but on the great scale I confess my addiction.
Coming here yesterday evening, I stopped the chaise
at the corner of Egham, to turn the finger-post at the corner
half round&mdash;sent all the people bound for London to Chertsey,
all the people destined for Egham to Windsor, and all the
people destined for Windsor to London&mdash;that's <em>my</em> way."</p>

<p>"Probably," said I, "but not theirs. And do you often
indulge yourself in these freaks?"</p>

<p>"Perpetually," replied Daly; "I've whipped off every
knocker in Sloane-street three nights running&mdash;a hundred and
ninety-four, exclusive of shops; and if ever the project of
lighting London with smoke should be brought to bear, I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_474" id="Page_474">[474]</a></span>
flatter myself you will hear of my darkening the whole parish
of Pancras, by grinding a gimblet through a gas-pipe."</p>

<p>"These frolics must cost something," said I.</p>

<p>"Occasionally," said my friend; "but what of that?
Every man has his pursuits&mdash;I have mine."</p>

<p>"I should think," replied I, "if you perform such tricks
often, your pursuits must be innumerable."</p>

<p>"What!" exclaimed Daly; "pursuits after me, you mean?
I'm obliged to you for <em>that</em>&mdash;I see we shall be better
acquainted&mdash;of that I am now quite certain. One thing I
<em>must</em> tell you of myself, because, although there is something
equivocal in the outset of the adventure, I set it all to rights
afterwards, and will prove to you that in fact all I did was
done for fun&mdash;pure fun."</p>

<p>I foresaw an awkward discovery of some sort by the prefatory
deprecation of criticism; however, I listened to my
slight acquaintance with complacency and confidence.</p>

<p>"You must know," said Daly, "that I once had a brother,&mdash;long
since dead,&mdash;and you must know that he was my
elder brother, and he went abroad; I remained at home, and
was my father's darling&mdash;he fancied nothing on earth was
like me. I was the wittiest, if not the wisest fellow breathing;
and I have seen my respectable parent shake his fat sides
with laughing at my jokes and antics, till the tears ran down
his rosy cheeks. Nevertheless I <em>had</em> a fault,&mdash;I cannot
distinctly aver that I have even yet overcome it,&mdash;I was
extravagant&mdash;extravagant in everything&mdash;extravagant in
mirth&mdash;extravagant in love&mdash;extravagant in money-matters.
After my respected parent's death, I lodged at an upholsterer's&mdash;excellent
man!&mdash;occupied his first floor&mdash;but paid him no
rent; on the contrary, borrowed money of him."</p>

<p>"Indeed!" said I, "I&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Don't frown, Mr. Gurney," interrupted Daly, "you will
find that it comes all right in the end. I'm as honest as a
Parsee&mdash;don't be alarmed&mdash;I was then much younger than
I am now; and, although the world unjustly, ungenerously,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_475" id="Page_475">[475]</a></span>
and invariably judge a man's character in after life by the
foibles of his youth, don't be prejudiced, but hear me. I
borrowed money of him&mdash;I consulted him upon all occasions&mdash;he
was delighted with me, I with <em>him</em>&mdash;reciprocity of
feeling, you know, and all that sort of thing. My upholsterer
was my <em>cabinet</em>-minister&mdash;who better? who fitter
to be consulted when any new measure was on the <em>tapis</em>?
So things went on for a year, at the end of which, I owed
him fourteen hundred and seventy-two pounds, thirteen
shillings, and ninepence halfpenny, without the interest."</p>

<p>"That was no joke, Mr. Daly," said I.</p>

<p>"No; but what followed was," continued my equivocal
friend. "My cabinet-minister applied for funds&mdash;I had
none on hand. I therefore quitted London, and retired to
the blest shades of Holyrood&mdash;not that this sort of constraint
was at all necessary, for my friend, the sofa-maker, never
troubled himself to inquire after me."</p>

<p>"Why, then, did you go?" said I.</p>

<p>"Why, you see I thought he might," replied Daly. "After
I <ins class="corr" title="Transcriber's Note&mdash;Original text: 'had l  ered'">had hovered</ins> about Scotland, seen the sights, visited the
Highlands, shot some grouse,&mdash;and a pretty job I made of
that, umph!&mdash;I returned to Edinburgh, and began to be
anxious to get back to London. I therefore took the resolution
of killing myself forthwith."</p>

<p>"Horrible!" said I.</p>

<p>"Most horrible!" replied he; "nevertheless, I put that
resolve into immediate execution."</p>

<p>"How?" I inquired.</p>

<p>"By transmitting an account of my death to the metropolitan
newspapers in these words&mdash;'Died, at Antigua, on
the 15th March, in the 28th year of his age, Robert Fergusson
Daly, Esq., son of the late Thomas Fergusson Daly,
Esq., of St. Mary Axe, London.'"</p>

<p>"What earthly purpose could that have answered?"</p>

<p>"You shall hear," said Daly. "About ten days after this
announcement, having 'incurred' for a suit of mourning, I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_476" id="Page_476">[476]</a></span>
proceeded to my friend the upholsterer. Dear man, I recollect
his little white bald head peering over his desk in the
counting-house as well as if it were but yesterday&mdash;in I went&mdash;made
a bow&mdash;up jumped my creditor.</p>

<p>"'Ah, Mr. Daly,' cried he, 'then what I have read in the
newspaper is not true!&mdash;you are alive and merry.'</p>

<p>"Upon which I, looking as grave as a judge, said with a
long-drawn sigh, 'Sir, I see you have fallen into the common
mistake.'</p>

<p>"'Mistake, sir,' said he, 'no mistake in the world! Why,
I read in the newspapers that you were dead. How those
fellows do fib!'</p>

<p>"'In this instance,' I replied, 'they are as true as the
tides to the moon&mdash;or the needle to the Pole.'</p>

<p>"'Why,' cried he, 'you are not dead, for here you
are!'</p>

<p>"'So I am,' said I; 'but I am not the Mr. Daly who died
in Antigua.'</p>

<p>"'That's very clear,' said the old cabinet-maker; 'for, as
I said before, here you are.'</p>

<p>"'Still,' said I, 'sir,'&mdash;I thought the sir good&mdash;'you do
not understand: I am the brother&mdash;the twin brother of poor
Bob Daly who lived here with you, and who has died, as I
unfortunately know, deep in your debt.'</p>

<p>"'What!' exclaimed the upholsterer, '<em>you</em> his brother!
Impossible&mdash;ridiculous! Why, I should know you from a
thousand by that little knob on your nose.'</p>

<p>"'That may be, sir,' said I; 'but I was born with a knob
on my nose as well as my brother. I assure you he is in his
grave at Antigua.'</p>

<p>"This astounded him, and he was proceeding to ring the
bell in order to call up the housemaid, who had made herself
particularly familiar with my knob, in order to identify me,
when I pacified him by fresh assurances that he was mistaken,
and that I was come to settle the account due from my late
brother to himself."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_477" id="Page_477">[477]</a></span></p>

<p>"This," said I, "was all very funny, no doubt; but <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">cui bono</i>?"</p>

<p>"<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Nous verrons</i>," said Daly. "The moment I talked of
paying, all doubt ended; he felt convinced that it could not
be me; for he was quite of opinion that at that time I had no
notion of muddling away my income in paying bills. So he
listened, looking all the while at my knob&mdash;you see the thing
I mean, Mr. Gurney," said Daly, pointing to a pimple; "till
at last I begged to see his account&mdash;he produced it&mdash;I sighed&mdash;so
did he.</p>

<p>"'Sir,' said he, 'this is&mdash;dear me, is it possible two
people should be so much alike?&mdash;your brother's last account
before he went.'</p>

<p>"I could not help saying, 'He is gone to his last account
now, sir.' If it had been to save my life, I could never
check my fun.</p>

<p>"'Lord, how like Mr. Robert that is!' said the upholsterer.</p>

<p>"'What is the amount?' said I.</p>

<p>"'Fourteen hundred and seventy-two pounds, thirteen
shillings, and ninepence halfpenny. As for interest, Mr. Daly,
I don't want it.'</p>

<p>"'Sir,' said I, drawing out of my pocket a handkerchief
whiter than unsunned snow, 'I honour and reverence you. I
can now account for the high respect and veneration with
which my poor brother Bob used to speak of you and write
about you. You shall judge what he has done;&mdash;he has
died worth three thousand five hundred pounds; the claims
upon him are numerous and heavy; in his letter, the last I
ever received from him, he directs me to make an equitable
division of his property.'</p>

<p>"'Poor fellow!' said the cabinet-maker.</p>

<p>"'An innocent young creature, with three children,' said
I, 'first claims his care.'</p>

<p>"'Dear me!' said the man. 'Rely upon it I won't interfere
there. No, no. I gave him credit further than he
asked it. I won't visit his sins upon those who, perhaps, are
helpless, and certainly blameless in this affair.'</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_478" id="Page_478">[478]</a></span></p>

<p>"There was something so kind in this, that I was near
betraying myself; but I should have spoiled the joke.</p>

<p>"'After those,' continued I, 'you come next; and, having
divided his assets fairly, he decided that he could, acting
conscientiously towards others, afford to pay you five shillings
in the pound upon the amount due; and, accordingly, I have
brought you to-day a sum calculated at that rate&mdash;that is to
say, three hundred and sixty-eight pounds, thirteen shillings
and sixpence, for I don't descend to fractions.'</p>

<p>"'Well, now,' said the honest old man, 'I love and honour
him for that. He needn't have paid me a farthing. I knew
not where he was;&mdash;and to think of me on his death-bed!&mdash;that,
sir, shows good principle; and as you are so like him in
everything else,&mdash;and how like him you are, to be sure!&mdash;I
hope and trust&mdash;don't be angry, sir&mdash;that you will follow the
example he has set you in the last act of his life.'</p>

<p>"'Then,' said I, 'you accept the proposal?'</p>

<p>"'Most happily, sir,' said he. 'I tell you I honour his
feelings. I had given the whole thing up as lost: I thought
he was a hard-hearted and a practised taker-in of credulous
men&mdash;&mdash;'</p>

<p>"'Sir,' said I, bowing, 'you little knew my poor brother
Bob if you thought that. Here, sir, is the money; all I ask,
as a satisfaction to the interesting young creature who survives
him, is a receipt in full of all demands as against him.'</p>

<p>"'In course, Mr. Daly,' said the upholsterer, taking the
notes I proffered. 'Why, la!' exclaimed he, 'I declare you
have got the very ring on, that I have seen a hundred times,
with a leetel patent key twisted into the inside, that he used
to wear.'</p>

<p>"'Yes,' said I, rather taken aback at this; for with all my
cunning I had forgotten to disring my finger for the occasion.
'Yes, it was the only thing he left me; and I wear it for his
sake.'</p>

<p>"'And how well it fits!' said the cabinet-maker.</p>

<p>"'Often the case with twins,' said I. 'There are two<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_479" id="Page_479">[479]</a></span>
hundred, three hundred, and fifty, a ten pound note, eight
guineas, and five shillings and sixpence; count it yourself.</p>

<p>"'And now,' said he, 'I am to give you a receipt in full;
to be sure I will. But I do wish you would do me one
favour, sir,' continued he; 'I wish you would let my housemaid
Becky see you; she was very fond of your poor brother,
and very attentive to him, and I should&mdash;I know it is taking
a great liberty&mdash;I should like her to see you.'</p>

<p>"'I should be too happy,' said I, trembling at the apprehension
that the girl, who was more than usually civil to me
while I lived in the lodgings, should make her appearance,
convinced that she would not be deceived as to the identity,
or believe in the story of two brothers having the same knobs
on their noses; 'but don't you think it might shock the poor
young woman?'</p>

<p>"'No, no, sir,' said he, looking over a black leather book
for a proper stamp; 'Becky isn't frightened at trifles; shall I
ring?'</p>

<p>"I could not help myself, and Becky was summoned.
Luckily, however, she had just stepped out to get something,
and satisfied, by the way in which the other servant conveyed
the intelligence to her master, that it was not very probable
she would soon return, I screwed my courage to the sticking-place,
and remained until he had written, signed, and delivered
my entire acquittance from my whole debt, in consideration
of the receipt of three hundred and sixty-eight pounds
thirteen shillings and sixpence; having secured which, I made
my bow and left my upholsterer, not ill pleased with the
adventure of the day."</p>

<p>"Yes, sir," said I, after I had heard this narrative, "but I
see no joke in all this: it appears to me that a person less
favourably disposed than myself would find a very different
name for such a proceeding."</p>

<p>"So would anybody," said my valuable friend, "if it were
not for the sequel. A short time after, I had the means to set
all right, and lost no time in doing so; I confessed my <em>ruse</em> to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_480" id="Page_480">[480]</a></span>
my worthy friend, made him laugh heartily at his own credulity,
paid him the difference, and gave Becky a guinea or
two."</p>

<p>I honestly confess, that although my new friend polished
off the end of his story with a few retributive facts, the account
of his adventure with the cabinet-maker did not very
much elevate him in my opinion, and I began again to repent
of having hastily engaged myself as a passenger in his boat, so
appropriately, as he himself said, called a "funny." The only
consolation I could afford myself arose from the consideration
that our connection would not be of long duration&mdash;that it
need never be renewed&mdash;that few people, if any, would see
me in my way up the river&mdash;and that, from all I had heard
of him from himself, he did not appear likely to die a watery
death, so that my personal safety was rather guaranteed than
not, by my having placed myself under his command in our
aquatic excursion.</p>

<p>I had never seen such a man before, nor have I ever seen
such a one since: from the time he sat down to dinner till all
was done, his tongue never ceased&mdash;he was <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">au-fait</i> at everything&mdash;played
billiards better than anybody I ever saw&mdash;jumped
higher&mdash;imitated birds and beasts, including men,
women, and children, more correctly&mdash;caught more fish in an
hour than all the rest of the punters did in three&mdash;sang all
sorts of songs&mdash;made speeches&mdash;and told stories of himself
which would have made my poor mother's hair stand on end.
One of his practical jokes, played off upon one of the ladies
of our party, I must set down. She had never been at Richmond
before, or if she had, knew none of the little peculiarities
attached to it. He desired the waiter to bring some
"maids of honour"&mdash;those cheesecakes for which the place
has been time out of mind so celebrated. The lady stared and
then laughed; Daly saw her surprise, and elicited all he wanted&mdash;her
innocent question of, "What do you mean by maids of
honour?" "Dear me," said he, "don't you know that this
is so courtly a place, and so completely under the influence of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_481" id="Page_481">[481]</a></span>
state etiquette, that everything in Richmond is called after
the functionaries of the palace? What are called cheesecakes
elsewhere, are here called maids of honour; a capon is a lord-chamberlain;
a goose, a lord-steward; a roast pig is a master
of the horse; a pair of ducks, grooms of the bedchamber;
and a gooseberry tart, a gentleman usher of the black rod;
and so on."</p>

<p>The unsophisticated lady was taken in; and with all the
confidence which Daly's gravity inspired, when she actually
saw the maids of honour make their appearance in the shape
of cheesecakes, convulsed the whole party, by turning to the
waiter and desiring him, in a sweet but decided tone, to bring
her a gentleman usher of the black rod, if they had one in
the house quite cold.</p>

<p>These were the sort of <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">plaisanteries</i> (<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">mauvaises</i>, if you
will) in which this most extraordinary person indulged. In
the sequel, I had occasion to see his versatile powers more
profitably engaged, and which led me to reflect somewhat
more seriously upon the adventure of the upholsterer and the
receipt in full of all demands.</p>

<p>The dinner was rather inconveniently despatched, in order
to suit the convenience of the engaged performers, and by
seven o'clock my new friend and myself were left to commence
our voyage up the river. His spirits appeared even higher
than they had been before, and I felt myself, when consigned
to his care, something in the same situation as Mr. O'Rourke
on the eagle's back: whither I was to be carried by his influence,
or how to be dashed down when he got tired of me
I could not clearly comprehend; nor were my apprehension
of consequences in any satisfactory degree diminished when
my perilous companion commenced a violent wordy attack
upon a very respectable round-bodied gentleman who was
sitting squeezed into the stern-sheets of a skiff, floating most
agreeably to himself adown the stream, the gentle south-west
breeze giving the sail of his boat a shape very similar to that
of his equally well-filled white dimity waistcoat.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_482" id="Page_482">[482]</a></span></p>

<p>"Hollo!" cried my friend Daly; "I say, you sir, what
are you doing in that boat?"</p>

<p>The suburban Josh maintained a dignified silence.</p>

<p>"I say, you sir," continued the undaunted joker, "what
are you doing there? you have no business in that boat, and
you know it!"</p>

<p>A slight yaw of the skiff into the wind's eye was the only
proof of the stout navigator's agitation.</p>

<p>Still Daly was inexorable, and he again called to the unhappy
mariner to get out of the boat. "I tell you, my fat
friend," cried he, "you have no business in that boat!"</p>

<p>Flesh and blood could not endure this reiterated declaration.
The ire of the Cockney was roused. "No business in this
boat, sir!" cried he, "what d'ye mean?"</p>

<p>"I mean what I say," said Daly; "you have no business
in it, and I'll prove it."</p>

<p>"I think, sir, you will prove no such thing," said the
navigator, whose progress through the water was none of the
quickest; "perhaps you don't know, sir, that this is my own
pleasure-boat?"</p>

<p>"That's it," said Daly, "now you <em>have</em> it&mdash;no man can
have any <em>business</em> in a <em>pleasure</em>-boat. Good-day, sir. That's
all."</p>

<p>I confess I was a good deal shocked at this mode of terminating
the colloquy. However, no ill consequences arose;
the fat man went his way, and so did we, and in a few
minutes more embarked in Daly's "pleasure"-boat, in which
I felt, according to his dictum, that I had no business whatever.</p>

<p>Richmond, which seems, every time one sees it, as if it
were dressed to look lovely for that particular day, was smiling
in all its radiance and gaiety; the velvet meadows of Twickenham,
studded with noble trees, looked cooler and greener
than ever; and my friend began to perform that incomprehensibly
agreeable exercise of pulling up against the stream,
when all at once a thought seemed to flash across his mind<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_483" id="Page_483">[483]</a></span>
and a look of regret sadden his countenance; the expression
was too distinct to be mistaken or disregarded.</p>

<p>"What," said I, "what is the matter? have you left
anything behind?"</p>

<p>"No," said he, laughing; "but if I had thought of it,
we would not have come away so soon from Richmond; and
I would have shown you some sport in Cockney-catching."</p>

<p>"What do you mean?" asked innocent I.</p>

<p>"A trick specially my own," replied Daly, "to be played
with the greatest success between the grounds of Sion and
Kew Gardens. Thus:&mdash;In the dusk of the evening&mdash;I
prescribe scientifically&mdash;take a strong line, fix him to a peg
in the bank of Sion, carry him across the river, and fix him
to another peg in the bank of Kew; strain him tight, and
then retire to watch the effect. Tide running down, presently
comes a Cockney couple, the man flirting and pulling, the
lady sitting and smiling; when they reach the chosen spot,
the tight line catches the Cockney Corydon on the back of his
head, and tumbles him forward at the feet of his Phyllis; in
a twinkling, the same effect is produced on the lady, with this
single simple difference, that the cord catches <em>her</em> under the
chin, and tumbles her backwards. In the confusion of the
moment, tide ebbing fast, the happy pair are swept down the
stream, and having, after the lapse of a few minutes, set
themselves to rights again, begin to wonder what has happened,
and of course never think of trying back against tide
to ascertain the cause; which, however, if they did, would
assist them little, for the moment you have caught your
Cockneys, you cast off the line from the peg, and the cause
of the mischief disappears from the sight&mdash;<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">probatum est</i>."</p>

<p>"That seems rather a serious joke," said I.</p>

<p>"Umph!" replied Daly; "perhaps you would prefer
keeping the line, but for my part I am not particular."</p>

<p>This he certainly need not have mentioned. Every
moment added fresh evidence to the fearful fact; I was
yet unprepared for what was to come.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_484" id="Page_484">[484]</a></span></p>

<p>"I wish," said my friend, as he plied the oar, "that we
had stayed a little longer at Richmond. I think one more
bottle of claret, <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">tête-à-tête</i>, would have been vastly agreeable."</p>

<p>"I should not have disliked it myself," said I. "Is it
impossible to repair the mischief?&mdash;is there no agreeable
retreat on these shores, in which we may solace ourselves for
our imprudence?"</p>

<p>"No," said my friend; "the Eel-pie House is a wretched
hole&mdash;the inns at Twickenham are all inland&mdash;there is nothing
marine short of the Toy, and we are to part long before I
reach that much-loved spot."</p>

<p>"Then," said I, "we must make up our minds to the
evil, and bear it as well as we can."</p>

<p>At this moment we were under the bank of a beautiful
garden, upon which opened a spacious bow-windowed dinner-room,
flanked by an extensive conservatory. Within the
circle of the window was placed a table, whereon stood
bottles and decanters, rising, as it were, from amidst a
cornucopia of the choicest fruits. Around this table were
seated a highly-respectable family; a portly gentleman,
whose cheeks and chin gave ample evidence that such refections
were "his custom always in the afternoon," and near
him a lady, evidently his better, if not his larger half&mdash;on
either side bloomed two young creatures, unquestionably
the daughters of the well-fed pair. Our appearance,
although the lawn was some twenty or thirty yards in depth,
had caught their attention, as their respective forms and
figures had attracted our notice.</p>

<p>"There," said I, "this scene is exhibited to us by our
evil genius, to tantalize us with the prospect we may not
enjoy."</p>

<p>"You are wrong," said Daly, "quite wrong&mdash;be quiet&mdash;beautiful
girls, cool wine, and agreeable society, are worth
making a dash for. Those girls will we become acquainted
with&mdash;that society will we join&mdash;those wines will we imbibe."</p>

<p>"Do you know them?" said I.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_485" id="Page_485">[485]</a></span></p>

<p>"Never saw them by any chance in my life," said Daly;
"but here goes&mdash;the thing is settled&mdash;arranged&mdash;done.
Have you a pocket-book and a pencil about you? if you
have, lend them to <em>me</em>; say nothing, and I will manage the
rest. Assent to all I assert, and stay in the boat till we are
invited to partake of the collation."</p>

<p>"But, my dear sir," said I.</p>

<p>"Mum," said Daly, at the same moment pulling the head
of his funny 'chock block,' as the sailors say, into the bank
of the garden, upon whose velvet surface he jumped with
the activity of an opera dancer. I sat in amazement,
doubting what he was about to do, and what I should do
myself. The first thing I saw was my friend pacing in
measured steps along the front of the terrace. He then
affected to write down something in my book&mdash;then he
stopped&mdash;raised his hand to his eyes, as if to make an
horizon in order to obtain a level&mdash;then noted something
more&mdash;and then began to pace the ground afresh.</p>

<p>"Bring the staff out of the boat," said he to me, with an
air of command, which was so extremely well assumed, that
I scarcely knew whether he were in joke or in earnest. I
obeyed, and landed with the staff. Without any further
ceremony, he stuck the pole into the lawn&mdash;a measure which,
as he whispered to me, while in the act of taking it, he felt
assured would bring things to a crisis.</p>

<p>Sure enough, after a certain ringing of the dinner-room
bell, which we heard, and which conveyed to Daly's mind a
conviction that he had created a sensation, a butler, <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">bien
poudre</i>, in a blue coat, white waistcoat, and black <em>et ceteras</em>,
followed at a properly-graduated distance by a strapping
footman, in a blue-and-scarlet livery, were seen approaching.
I thought the next step would be our sudden and unceremonious
expulsion from the Eden he had trespassed upon&mdash;not
so my friend, who continued pacing, and measuring, and
"jotting down," until the minister for the home department
was at his elbow.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_486" id="Page_486">[486]</a></span></p>

<p>"I beg your pardon, gentlemen," said the butler, "but&mdash;my
master's compliments, begs to know what your pleasure
here is&mdash;it is not usual for strangers to land&mdash;and&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Exactly like the man in the boat, sir," said Daly, "only
quite the reverse. I am not here for pleasure&mdash;business
calls me here&mdash;duty, sir&mdash;duty. Here, Mr. Higgins, carry
the staff to that stump."</p>

<p>These words were addressed to me, and I, completely <ins class="corr" title="Transcriber's Note&mdash;Original text: 'in-atuated'">infatuated</ins>&mdash;fascinated,
like the bird by the rattle-snake&mdash;did
as I was told, not daring to rebel, lest a <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">dénoûment</i> might
ensue, which would <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">éclater</i> in our being jointly and severally
kicked into the river, in which case, from the very little, or
rather the very great deal, which I had seen of my companion
during our short acquaintance, I felt perfectly certain
that <em>I</em> should sink, and <em>he</em> would swim; and that, while I
was floundering in all the agonies of ignominy and disgrace,
he would be capering and flourishing with the two pretty
girls in the dining-room, laying all the blame of the affair
upon my most incompetent shoulders, and cracking his jokes
upon the tyro who had so blunderingly botched the business.</p>

<p>The butler, who found that he made very little impression
upon Daly, seemed inclined to come at <em>me</em>, which, as I had
not the slightest idea of the game my companion was playing,
nor the faintest notion what he expected to be the result,
alarmed me considerably. Daly was too much on the alert,
however, to permit me to be cross-questioned.</p>

<p>"Sir," said he to the butler, "present my compliments
to your master, and make my humble apologies for the
liberty I am obliged to take. I am the acting deputy-assistant
surveyor of the Grand Junction Paddington Canal
Company, and an Act of Parliament is just about to be
applied for, to construct and cut a branch from the basin at
Brentford into the river Thames, near this point. A great
deal depends upon my decision as to the line it will take,
and I should not have ventured to land without apprising
your master of my business, but that no time is to be lost,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_487" id="Page_487">[487]</a></span>
inasmuch as my plan for the cut must be ready for the committee
to-morrow."</p>

<p>"Cut a canal through my master's grounds, sir?" said the
butler.</p>

<p>"Right through," said Daly, poking the fore-finger of his
right hand very nearly into the butler's left eye; "and what
I am now so particular about is, I am most anxious that the
line should not take down the corner of the conservatory."</p>

<p>"Dear me, sir," said the man, "my mistress would go
mad at the very thought of such a thing. Will you just
wait, sir, while I speak to Sir Timothy?"</p>

<p>"Certainly," said he; "and assure him&mdash;assure Sir
Timothy&mdash;that I will do all I can to preserve the elevation
of his mansion; for, as it all depends upon my opinion, I
shall, of course, be extremely scrupulous how I decide."</p>

<p>"I am sure, sir," said the astounded and mollified butler,
"Sir Timothy will be greatly obliged to you. I'll be back
directly, sir."</p>

<p>Saying which, the butler returned to the house, and giving
a significant look at the strapping footman, with the grenadier
shoulders and balustrade legs, which seemed to imply that
he need not kick us into the water till he had consulted his
master, the fellow followed him, which afforded me an
opportunity of asking my volatile friend what the deuce he
was at.</p>

<p>"Leave me alone," said he,&mdash;</p>

<p>Who knows but we may make an agreeable and permanent
acquaintance with this interesting family?"</p>

<p>"But," said I, "you don't even know their name."</p>

<p>"You are in error," replied Daly; "the man's name <em>is</em>
known to me."</p>

<p>"Then perhaps you are known to <em>him</em>," said I.</p>

<p>"That is a <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">non sequitur</i>," said Daly; "I knew nothing of
him before I landed here&mdash;now I am <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">au-fait</i>&mdash;my friend
in the powder and sticking-plasters calls his master Sir
Timothy. There are hundreds of Sir Timothies; but what
do I, upon hearing this little distinctive appellation, but
glance my eye to the livery-button of the lacquey&mdash;and
what do I see there? a serpent issuing from and piercing a
garb or gerb. The crest is unique&mdash;<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">ergo</i>, my new acquaintance
is neither more nor less than Sir Timothy Dod."</p>

<p>"Why," said I, "you are, like myself, a bit of a herald,
too!"</p>

<p>"Exactly," replied Daly; "in my composition are</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<p class="verse">'Arts with <em>arms</em> contending;'</p>
</div></div></div>

<p class="noindent">I am a bit of every thing; but somehow all my accomplishments
are so jumbled, and each is so minute in itself, that
they are patched together in my mind like the squares of a
harlequin's jacket, only to make their master ridiculous.
Here, however, comes Sir Timothy himself. You are my
clerk&mdash;keep the staff and the joke up, and you shall be
repaid with some of Tim's very best Lafitte, or I'm an ass."</p>

<p>"Good-day, sir," said Sir Timothy, somewhat warmed with
the intelligence given him by the butler, and the exertion of
trotting him across his lawn. "My servant tells me that
you are here for the purpose of deciding upon the line of
some new branch of the Paddington Canal;&mdash;it is very
extraordinary I never should have heard of it!"</p>

<p>"You ought, Sir Timothy," said Daly, "to have been
apprised of it. Do you understand much of ground-plans,
Sir Timothy?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_489" id="Page_489">[489]</a></span></p>

<p>"No, sir; very little indeed," replied the worthy knight.</p>

<p>"So much the better," I heard Daly distinctly say, for he
could not resist an impulse. "If you will just cast your eye
over this paper, I will endeavour to explain, sir. A, there
you see;&mdash;A is your house, Sir Timothy; B is the conservatory;
C is the river,&mdash;that perhaps you will think strange?"</p>

<p>"No, sir," said Sir Timothy, "not at all."</p>

<p>"Then, sir, D, E, F, and G are the points, from which I
take the direct line from the bridge at Brentford; and thus
you perceive, by continuing that line to the corner of Twickenham
churchyard, where the <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">embouchure</i> is to be&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"The what, sir?" said Sir Timothy.</p>

<p>"The mouth, sir,&mdash;the entrance to the new branch, the
canal will clip your conservatory diagonally to the extent of
about eighteen feet six inches, and leave it deprived of its
original dimensions somewhat in the shape of a cocked-hat
box. You see&mdash;so, sir,&mdash;H, I, K."</p>

<p>"I give you my honour, sir," said Sir Timothy, "such a
thing would drive Lady Dod mad!"</p>

<p>"I admit it would be a dreadful cut," said Daly; "and
then the noise of the bargemen and the barge-horses close
under the windows,&mdash;clanking chains,&mdash;horrible oaths,&mdash;disgusting
language&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"My daughters' bed-rooms are at that end of the house,"
said Sir Timothy. "What am I to do, sir? What interest
can I make? Are the magistrates&mdash;are the&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"No, sir," said Daly, with a face of the most imperturbable
gravity; "all that would be perfectly unavailing. The
decision as to the line rests entirely with me; and, as I said
to Mr. Higgins, my assistant,&mdash;Higgins," continued he,
calling me to him, "let me present you to Sir Timothy Dod,&mdash;I
said to Higgins, what a pity it would be to disturb the
Dods,&mdash;what a cut at their comforts;&mdash;it goes against my
heart to send in the plan, but the line is so decidedly the
shortest. 'Ah, sir!' says Higgins to me, with a deep sigh,
I assure you,&mdash;'but <em>do</em> consider the conservatory.'"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_490" id="Page_490">[490]</a></span></p>

<p>"I'm sure, sir," said Sir Timothy, extending his hand to
me, "I feel very grateful for your kindness. It would indeed
be a sad thing; and must the decision be made so soon?"</p>

<p>"Immediately, sir," said Daly; "but we are keeping you
out here in the open air without your hat. I am afraid, sir,
you may catch cold."</p>

<p>"Oh no, sir," said Sir Timothy; "don't mind that.
Perhaps, gentlemen, you will do me the kindness to walk in.
The servants shall take care of your boat. I will introduce
you to Lady Dod, she must try what <em>her</em> influence can effect,
and I am sure you have the disposition to serve us. Here,
Philip, James, George, some of you, come and make this
boat fast, and stay down by her while the gentlemen stop.
Let me show you the way, gentlemen."</p>

<p>I never shall forget the look which Daly gave me as we
followed the respectable knight to his lady and family,&mdash;the
triumphant chuckle of his countenance, the daring laugh in
his eyes; while I, who only saw in the success of the design
the beginning of a signal defeat, scarce knew whether I was
walking on my head or my heels: resistance or remonstrance
was equally vain under the circumstances, and in a few
minutes we found ourselves in the presence of Lady Dod
and her daughters, breathing an atmosphere redolent with
the fumes of the departed dinner, and the still remaining
fruit and wine. I never was so abashed in my life. My
friend, on the contrary, seemed perfectly at home; and,
placing himself beside her ladyship, made a sign for me to
occupy a vacant seat between the young ladies. Never did
I see two more lovely girls.</p>

<p>The courtesy of Sir Timothy, the sweetness of my lady,
and the constrained fun of the girls, were, I admit, when I
recovered my composure in some degree, a good treat; while
Daly, "helping himself and passing the bottle" to <em>me</em>, kept
up a fire of conversation, which, if the senior Dods had
known anything of the world, would have convinced them in
ten minutes that the part of acting deputy-assistant measurer<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_491" id="Page_491">[491]</a></span>
was an assumed one. It certainly was a sight to see the
respectable lady of the house pleading the cause of her
conservatory, and piling the choicest fruits upon the plate of
the arbiter of her destinies, while Fanny's civilities to me
were displayed with equal zeal and far superior grace. I
would have given the world to have owned the truth; and I
am sure, if we had done so, we should not have been the
worse received; for, independently of the excellence of the
joke and the impudence of the proceeding, the relief which
would have been afforded to the minds of the whole Doddery
would have ensured us their eternal favour and affection.</p>

<p>Daly having finished the claret, and taken a last "stopper
over all" (as the sailors say) of sherry, gave me the signal
for departure. I, too, gladly took the hint, and drew back
my chair. Fanny looked as if she thought we were in a
hurry; however, it was getting late, and my master had
some distance to pull. We accordingly rose and prepared
to take leave. I bowed my adieu to the girls, and shook
hands with Fanny, at which I saw Augusta toss back her
head and throw up her sparkling eyes, as much as to say,
"Well, Fanny," meaning exactly the reverse. I bowed low
to my Lady Dod, and Sir Timothy attended us to our boat.
I stepped in; Daly was at the bow; Sir Timothy desired
the man who had been left in charge of the funny to go
away; and then I saw, with doubt and trepidation, the
respectable dupe of Daly's consummate impudence shake
him by the hand with a peculiarity of manner which particularly
attracted my attention. I saw him in the execution
of this manœuvre press upon his palm a bank-note, with
a flourish in the corner like the top of a raspberry tartlet.</p>

<p>I never was more agitated. If Daly took this bribe for
saving the corner of the conservatory, it was an act of
swindling. The strawberries, grapes, and claret, were fit
matters of joke, although I admit that it was carrying the
joke a little too far; but money,&mdash;if he took <em>that</em>, I was resolved
to avow the whole affair to Sir Timothy, show up my<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_492" id="Page_492">[492]</a></span>
companion, and leave him to the fate he deserved. Judge
my mingled delight and horror when I heard him say,&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>"Sir! what I have done in your house or in your society
to induce you to believe me capable of taking a bribe to compromise
my duty, I really don't know. Mr. Higgins, I call
you to witness that this person has had the insolence to put a
fifty-pound bank-note into my hand. Witness, too, the manner
in which I throw it back to him." Here he suited the
word to the action. "Learn, old gentleman," continued he,
with an anger so well feigned that I almost believed him in
earnest, "that neither fifty nor fifty thousand pounds will
warp an honest man from the duty he owes to his employers;
and so, sir, good-night, and rely upon it, your conservatory
goes,&mdash;rely upon it, Sir Timothy;&mdash;it comes in the right line,
and the short line, and down it goes&mdash;and I feel it incumbent
on me not only to tell the history of your petty bribe, but to
prove my unimpeachable integrity by running the canal right
under your dining-room windows; and so, sir, good-night."</p>

<p>Saying which he jumped into the boat, and, pulling away
manfully, left his unfortunate victim in all the horrors of
defeated corruption, and the certainty of the destruction of
his most favourite object, for the preservation of which he
had actually crammed his betrayers, and committed himself
to a perfect stranger.</p>


<hr class="r15" />
<h3>THE BALLET.</h3>

<p>Not being at this present writing in love with any opera
dancer, we can see with "eyes unprejudiced," that the performances
to which we allude (<em>ballets</em>) are in the highest
possible degree objectionable as referring to taste, and disgusting
as relating to decency.</p>

<p>First, then, as to taste&mdash;nobody upon earth, we should
think, can be bold enough to assert that the horizontal<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_493" id="Page_493">[493]</a></span>
elevation of the female leg, and the rapid twisting of the
body&mdash;the subsequent attitude and expansion of the arms&mdash;are
graceful&mdash;we mean merely as to dancing. No man
certainly, except those whose intellects and appetites are
more debased than those of men in general, can feel either
amusement or gratification in such an exhibition.</p>

<p>Woman is so charming, so fascinating, so winning, and
so ruling by the attractions which properly belong to her&mdash;by
her delicacy&mdash;her gentleness&mdash;and her modesty&mdash;that we
honestly confess, whenever we see a lovely girl doing that
which degrades her, which must lower her even in her own
estimation, we feel a pang of regret, and lament to find
conduct applauded to the very echo which reduces the
beautiful creatures before us to a mere animal in a state of
exhibition.</p>

<p>But if there really be men who take delight in the
"<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Ionici motus</i>" of the Italian Opera, surely <em>our own</em> women
should be spared the sight of such indelicacies: nothing
which the Roman satirist mentions as tending to destroy
the delicate feelings of the female sex could possibly be
worse than those which week after week may be seen in the
Haymarket.</p>

<p>We have strenuously attacked, for its unnatural indecency,
the custom of dressing actresses in men's attire
upon the English stage, but a lady in small clothes is better
on a public theatre than a lady with no clothes at all.</p>

<p>We are quite ready to admit, without in the smallest
degree lamenting, the superiority of foreigners over the
natives of England in the art and mystery of cutting capers,
and if the ladies and gentlemen annually imported jumped as
high as the volteurs in Potier's "Danaides" at the Porte St.
Martin, neither would our envy nor our grief be excited;
but we certainly do eye with mistrust and jealousy the
avidity with which "foreign manners," "foreign customs,"
and "foreign morality," are received into our dear and much-loved
country.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_494" id="Page_494">[494]</a></span></p>

<p>While custom sanctions the nightly commission of
waltzing in our best society, it perhaps is only matter of
consolation to the matrons who permit their daughters to be
operated upon in the mysteries of that dance, to see that
women can be found to commit grosser indelicacies even on
a public stage.</p>

<p>A correspondent of the <cite>Spectator</cite>, in the 67th Number,
Vol. I., describes accurately under another name the
mechanical part of the foreign waltz of these days, and
says:&mdash;"I suppose this diversion was first invented to keep
up a good understanding between young men and women;
but I am sure, had you been here, you would have seen great
matter for speculation."</p>

<p>We say so now; but the waltz has proved a bad
speculation to the very dowagers who allow it to be committed;
for, as can be proved by reference to fashionable
parish registers, there have been fewer marriages in good
society by one half, annually upon the average, since the
introduction of this irritating indecency into England.</p>

<p>If, therefore, the public dances at the King's Theatre are
looked at, merely as authorities for the conduct of private
balls, the matter is still worse; but we have too high an
opinion of our countrywomen in general to think this of
them, and we are sure that we are speaking the sentiment of
the most amiable and the most charming when we raise the
voice of rebuke against the dress and deportment of the
Italian <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Corps de Ballet</i>.</p>

<p>One advocate we are certain to have in the person of an
old gentlewoman next to whom we sat last Saturday se'nnight,
who clearly had never been at the Opera during the whole
course of her long and doubtlessly respectable life, till that
very evening.</p>

<p>When the ballet commenced, she appeared delighted;
but when one of the principal females began to elevate her
leg beyond the horizontal, she began evidently to fidget, and
make a sort of see-saw motion with her head and body, in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_495" id="Page_495">[495]</a></span>
pure agitation; at every lofty jump I heard her ejaculate a
little "Oh!" at a somewhat lengthened <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">pirouette</i> she exclaimed,
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">sotte voce</i>, "Ah!" with a sigh; but at length, when a
tremendous whirl had divested the greater part of the performer's
figure of drapery&mdash;the band ceasing at the moment
to give time to the twirl&mdash;the poor old lady screamed out,
"Oh, la!"&mdash;which was heard all over the house, and caused
a shout of laughter at the expense of a poor, sober-minded
Englishwoman, whose nerves had not been screwed up to a
sufficiently fashionable pitch to witness what she saw was a
perfect, but thought must have been an accidental exposure,
of more of a woman's person than is usually given to the
gaze of the million.</p>

<p>Whitlings and whipsters, dandies, demireps, and dancers
may rank us with our fat friend in the tabby silk, to whom
we have just referred, if they please; but we will always
run the risk of being counted unfashionable rather than
immoral.</p>

<p>So few people moving in the world take the trouble of
thinking for themselves, that it is necessary to open their
eyes to their own improprieties; the natural answer to a
question, "How can you suffer your daughters to witness
such exhibitions?" is, "Why, everybody else goes, why should
not they?" And then, the numerous avocations of an Opera-house
evening divert the attention from the stage. True;
but there is a class of women differently situated, who are
subject to the nuisance, merely because those who do not
care about it are indifferent to its correction; we mean the
daughters and wives of respectable aldermen and drysalters,
and tradesmen of a superior class, who are rattled and shaken
to the Opera once or twice in the season, in a hackney-coach,
and come into the pit all over finery, with long straws
abstracted from "their carriage," sticking in their flounces.</p>

<p>Who is there that does not know that the Lady
Patronesses of Almack's have interdicted pantaloons, tight or
loose, at their assemblies? We have seen a MS. instruction<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_496" id="Page_496">[496]</a></span>
(which, alas! never was printed) from this mighty conclave,
announcing their fiat in these words: "<em>Gentlemen will not be
admitted without breeches and stockings!</em>"</p>

<p>No sooner was this mandate, in whatever terms the
published one was couched, fulminated from King Street,
than the "lean and slippered pantaloon" was exterminated,
and, as the Directresses directed, "short hose" were the
order of the day.</p>

<p>If the same lovely and honourable ladies were to take the
Opera House under their purifying control, and issue, in the
same spirit at least, an order that "Ladies will not be
permitted to appear without &mdash;&mdash;" (whatever may be the
proper names for the drapery of females) we are quite convinced
that they would render a great service to society, and
extricate the national character from a reproach which the
tacit endurance of such grossnesses has, in the minds of all
moderate people, unfortunately cast upon it at present.&mdash;<cite>John
Bull</cite>, 1823.</p>

<h3>TOLL-GATES AND THEIR KEEPERS.</h3>

<p>Few persons can have passed through life, or London,
without having experienced more or less insult from the
authoritative manner and coarse language of the fellows
who keep the different toll-bars round the metropolis; but
even were those persons uniformly civil and well-behaved,
the innumerable demands which they are authorised to
make, and the necessary frequency of their conversation and
appeals to the traveller, are of themselves enough to provoke
the impatience of the most placid passenger in Christendom.</p>

</div>

<p>We will select one line of about three or four miles,
which will answer by way of an example of what we
mean: A man, driving himself (without a servant), starts
from Bishopsgate-street for Kilburn. The day is cold and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_497" id="Page_497">[497]</a></span>rainy&mdash;his fingers are benumbed; his two coats buttoned
up; his money in tight pantaloon-pockets; his horse restive,
apt to kick if the reins touch his tail; his gloves soaked
with wet; and himself half-an-hour too late for dinner.
He has to pull up in the middle of the street in Shoreditch,
and pay a toll;&mdash;he means to return, therefore he takes
a ticket, letter <span class="fs70">A</span>. On reaching Shoreditch Church, he turns
into the Curtain Road, pulls up again, drags off his wet glove
with his teeth, his other hand being fully occupied in holding
up the reins and the whip; pays again; gets another ticket,
number 482; drags on his glove; buttons up his coats,
and rattles away into Old Street Road; another gate; more
pulling and poking, and unbuttoning and squeezing. He
pays, and takes another ticket, letter <span class="fs70">L</span>. The operation of
getting all to rights takes place once more, nor is it repeated
until he reaches Goswell Street Road; here he performs all
the ceremonies we have already described, for a fourth time,
and gets a fourth ticket, 732, which is to clear him through
the gates in the New Road, as far as the bottom of Pentonville;&mdash;arrived
there, he performs once more all the same
evolutions, and procures a fifth ticket, letter <span class="fs70">X</span>, which, unless
some sinister accident occur, is to carry him clear to the
Paddington Road; but opening the fine space of the Regent's
Park, at the top of Portland Street, the north breeze blowing
fresh from Hampstead, bursts upon his buggy, and all the
tickets which he had received from all the gates which he
has paid, and which he had stuffed <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">seriatim</i> between the
cushion and lining of his dennet, suddenly rise, like a covey
of partridges, from the corner, and he sees the dingy
vouchers for his expenditure proceeding down Portland
Street at full speed. They are rescued, however, muddy
and filthy as they are, by the sweeper of the crossing, who
is, of course, rewarded by the driver for his attention with
a larger sum than he had originally disbursed for all the
gates; and when deposited again in the vehicle, not in their
former order of arrangement, the unfortunate traveller<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_498" id="Page_498">[498]</a></span>
spends at least ten minutes at the next gate in selecting the
particular ticket which is there required to insure his free
passage.</p>

<p>Conquering all these difficulties, he reaches Paddington
Gate, where he pays afresh, and obtains a ticket, 691,
with which he proceeds swimmingly until stopped again
at Kilburn, to pay a toll, which would clear him all the
way to Stanmore, if he were not going to dine at a house three
doors beyond the very turnpike, where he pays for the
seventh time, and where he obtains a seventh ticket, letter <span class="fs70">G</span>.</p>

<p>He dines and "wines;" and the bee's-wing from the
citizen's port gives new velocity to Time. The dennet
was ordered at eleven; and, although neither tides nor
the old gentleman just mentioned, wait for any man, except
Tom Hill, horses and dennets will. It is nearer midnight
than eleven when the visitor departs, even better buttoned
up than in the morning, his lamps giving cheerfulness to
the equipage, and light to the road; and his horse whisking
along (his nostrils pouring forth breath like smoke from
safety-valves), and the whole affair actually in motion at
the rate of ten miles per hour. Stopped at Paddington.
"Pay here?"&mdash;"<span class="fs70">L</span>."&mdash;"Won't do."&mdash;"<span class="fs70">G</span>?"&mdash;(The horse
fidgety all this time, and the driver trying to read the dirty
tickets by the little light which is emitted through the <em>tops</em>
of his lamps,)&mdash;"<span class="fs70">X</span>?"&mdash;"It's no letter, I tell you?"&mdash;"482,"&mdash;"No."
At this juncture the clock strikes twelve&mdash;the
driver is told that his reading and rummaging are alike
useless, for that a new day has begun. The coats are,
therefore, unbuttoned&mdash;the gloves pulled off&mdash;the money
to be fished out&mdash;the driver discovers that his last shilling
was paid to the ostler at the inn where his horse was fed
and that he must change a sovereign to pay the gate. This
operation the toll-keeper performs; nor does the driver
discover, until the morning, that one of the half-crowns and
four of the shillings which he has received, are bad.
Satisfied, however, with what has occurred, he determines<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_499" id="Page_499">[499]</a></span>
at all hazards to drive home over the stones, and avoid
all further importunities from the turnpike-keepers. Accordingly,
away he goes along Oxford Street, over the
pavement, working into one hole and tumbling into another,
like a ball on a <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">trou madame</i> table, until, at the end of George
Street, St. Giles's, snap goes his axle-tree; away goes his
horse, dashing the dennet against a post at the corner of
Plumtree Street, leaving the driver, with his collar-bone and
left arm broken, on the pavement, at the mercy of two or
three popish bricklayers and a couple of women of the town,
who humanely lift him to the coach-stand, and deposit
him in a hackney-chariot, having previously cut off the
skirts of both his coats, and relieved him, not only of his
loose change, but of a gold repeater, a snuff-box, and a
pocket-book full of notes and memoranda, of no use but
to the owner.</p>

<p>The unhappy victim at length reaches home, in agonies
from the continued roughness of the pre-adamite pavement,
is put to bed&mdash;doctors are sent for, the fractures are
reduced, and in seven weeks he is able to crawl into his
counting-house to write a cheque for a new dennet, and
give his people orders to shoot his valuable horse, who
has so dreadfully injured himself on the fatal night as to
be past recovery.</p>

<h3>TOM SHERIDAN'S ADVENTURE.<a name="FNanchor_66" id="FNanchor_66"></a><a href="#Footnote_66" class="fnanchor">[66]</a></h3>

<p>Tom Sheridan was staying at Lord Craven's at Benham
(or rather Hampstead), and one day proceeded on a shooting
excursion, like Hawthorn, with only "his dog and his gun,"
on foot, and unattended by companion or keeper; the
sport was bad&mdash;the birds few and shy&mdash;and he walked and
walked in search of game, until, unconsciously, he entered
the domain of some neighbouring squire.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_500" id="Page_500">[500]</a></span></p>
<p>A very short time after, he perceived advancing towards
him, at the top of his speed, a jolly, comfortable-looking
gentleman, followed by a servant, armed, as it appeared,
for conflict. Tom took up a position, and waited the
approach of the enemy.</p>

<p>"Hallo! you sir," said the squire, when within half-earshot,
"what are you doing here, sir, eh?"</p>

<p>"I'm shooting, sir," said Tom.</p>

<p>"Do you know where you are, sir?" said the
squire.</p>

<p>"I'm here, sir," said Tom.</p>

<p>"Here, sir," said the squire, growing angry; "and do
you know where here <em>is</em>, sir? These, sir, are <em>my</em> manors;
what d'ye think of that, sir, eh?"</p>

<p>"Why, sir, as to your manners," said Tom, "I can't
say they seem over agreeable."</p>

<p>"I don't want any jokes, sir," said the squire, "I hate
jokes. Who are you, sir?&mdash;what are you?"</p>

<p>"Why, sir," said Tom, "my name is Sheridan&mdash;I am
staying at Lord Craven's&mdash;I have come out for some
sport&mdash;I have not had any, and I am not aware that I
am trespassing."</p>

<p>"Sheridan!" said the squire, cooling a little; "oh, from
Lord Craven's, eh? Well, sir, I could not know <em>that</em>,
sir&mdash;I&mdash;&mdash;'</p>

<p>"No, sir," said Tom, "but you need not have been in
a passion."</p>

<p>"Not in a passion! Mr. Sheridan," said the squire,
"you don't know, sir, what these preserves have cost me,
and the pains and trouble I have been at with them; it's
all very well for <em>you</em> to talk, but if you were in <em>my</em> place
I should like to know what <em>you</em> would say upon such an
occasion."</p>

<p>"Why, sir," said Tom, "if I were in <em>your</em> place, under
all the circumstances, I should say&mdash;'I am convinced,
Mr. Sheridan, you did not mean to annoy me; and, as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_501" id="Page_501">[501]</a></span>
you look a good deal tired, perhaps you'll come up to my
house and take some refreshment?'"</p>

<p>The squire was hit hard by this nonchalance, and (as
the newspapers say), "it is needless to add," acted upon
Sheridan's suggestion.</p>

<p>"So far," said poor Tom, "the story tells for me,&mdash;now
you shall hear the sequel."</p>

<p>After having regaled himself at the squire's house, and
having said five hundred more good things than he swallowed;
having delighted his host, and more than half won
the hearts of his wife and daughters, the sportsman proceeded
on his return homewards.</p>

<p>In the course of his walk he passed through a farm-yard;
in the front of the farm-house was a green, in the
centre of which was a pond, in the pond were ducks
innumerable swimming and diving; on its verdant banks
a motley group of gallant cocks and pert partlets, picking
and feeding&mdash;the farmer was leaning over the hatch of
the barn, which stood near two cottages on the side of
the green.</p>

<p>Tom hated to go back with an empty bag; and having
failed in his attempts at higher game, it struck him as a
good joke to ridicule the exploits of the day himself, in
order to prevent any one else from doing it for him, and
he thought to carry home a certain number of the domestic
inhabitants of the pond and its vicinity would serve the
purpose admirably. Accordingly, up he goes to the farmer
and accosts him very civilly&mdash;</p>

<p>"My good friend," says Tom, "I'll make you an offer."</p>

<p>"Of what, sur?" says the farmer.</p>

<p>"Why," replies Tom, "I've been out all day fagging
after birds, and haven't had a shot&mdash;now, both my barrels
are loaded&mdash;I should like to take home something; what
shall I give you to let me have a shot with each barrel
at those ducks and fowls&mdash;I standing here&mdash;and to have
whatever I kill?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_502" id="Page_502">[502]</a></span></p>

<p>"What sort of a shot are you?" said the farmer.</p>

<p>"Fairish," said Tom, "fairish."</p>

<p>"And to <em>have</em> all you kill?" said the farmer, "eh?"</p>

<p>"Exactly so," said Tom.</p>

<p>"Half a guinea," said the farmer.</p>

<p>"That's too much," said Tom. "I'll tell you what I'll
do&mdash;I'll give you a seven-shilling piece, which happens to
be all the money I have in my pocket."</p>

<p>"Well," said the man, "hand it over."</p>

<p>The payment was made&mdash;Tom, true to his bargain,
took his post by the barn-door, and let fly with one barrel
and then with the other; and such quacking and splashing,
and screaming and fluttering, had never been seen in that
place before.</p>

<p>Away ran Tom, and, delighted at his success, picked
up first a hen, then a chicken, then fished out a dying
duck or two, and so on, until he numbered eight head of
domestic game, with which his bag was nobly distended.</p>

<p>"Those were right good shots, sir," said the farmer.</p>

<p>"Yes," said Tom, "eight ducks and fowls were more
than you bargained for, old fellow&mdash;worth rather more, I
suspect, than seven shillings&mdash;eh?"</p>

<p>"Why, yes," said the man, scratching his head&mdash;"I
think they be; but what do I care for that&mdash;<em>they are none
of them mine</em>!"</p>

<p>"Here," said Tom, "I was for once in my life <em>beaten</em>,
and made off as fast as I could, for fear the right owner
of my game might make his appearance&mdash;not but that I
could have given the fellow that took me in seven times as
much as I did for his cunning and coolness."</p>

<p class="verse">And seize whomsoever by chance they might meet;</p>
<p class="verse">And before the bright sun was aloft in the sky,</p>

<h3>THE SPLENDID ANNUAL;<a name="FNanchor_74" id="FNanchor_74"></a><a href="#Footnote_74" class="fnanchor">[74]</a></h3>

<p class="center smcap">Or, Fortunes and Misfortunes of a Lord Mayor.</p>

<p>Literature, even in this literary age, is not the ordinary
pursuit of the citizens of London, although every merchant
is necessarily a man of letters, and underwriters are as
common as cucumbers. Notwithstanding, however, my
being a citizen, I am tempted to disclose the miseries and
misfortunes of my life in these pages, because, having heard
the "Anniversary" called a splendid annual, I hope for
sympathy from its readers, seeing that I have been a
"splendid annual" myself.</p>

<p>My name is Scropps&mdash;I <em>am</em> an Alderman&mdash;I <em>was</em> Sheriff&mdash;I
<em>have been</em> Lord Mayor&mdash;and the three great eras of my
existence were the year of my shrievalty, the year of my
mayoralty, and the year after it. Until I had passed through
this ordeal I had no conception of the extremes of happiness
and wretchedness to which a human being may be carried,
nor ever believed that society presented to its members an
eminence so exalted as that which I once touched, or
imagined a fall so great as that which I experienced.</p>

<p>I came originally from that place to which persons of
bad character are sent&mdash;I mean Coventry, where my father
for many years contributed his share to the success of parliamentary
candidates, the happiness of new married couples,
and even the gratification of ambitious courtiers, by taking
part in the manufacture of ribands for election cockades,
wedding favours, and cordons of chivalry; but trade failed,
and, like his betters, he became bankrupt, but, unlike his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_524" id="Page_524">[524]</a></span>
betters, without any consequent advantage to himself; and
I, at the age of fifteen, was thrown upon the world with
nothing but a strong constitution, a moderate education, and
fifteen shillings and elevenpence three farthings in my pocket.</p>

<p>With these qualifications I started from my native town
on a pedestrian excursion to London; and, although I fell
into none of those romantic adventures of which I had read
at school, I met with more kindness than the world generally
gets credit for, and on the fourth day after my departure,
having slept soundly, if not magnificently, every night, and
eaten with an appetite which my mode of travelling was
admirably calculated to stimulate, reached the great metropolis,
having preserved of my patrimony no less a sum than
nine shillings and sevenpence.</p>

<p>The bells of one of the churches in the city were ringing
merrily as I descended the heights of Islington; and were it
not that my patronymic Scropps never could, under the most
improved system of campanology, be jingled into anything
harmonious, I have no doubt I, like my great predecessor
Whittington, might have heard in that peal a prediction of
my future exaltation; certain it is I did not; and, wearied
with my journey, I took up my lodging for the night at a
very humble house near Smithfield, to which I had been
kindly recommended by the driver of a return post-chaise,
of whose liberal offer of the moiety of his bar to town, I had
availed myself at Barnet.</p>

<p>As it is not my intention to deduce a moral from my progress
in the world at this period of my life, I need not here
dilate upon the good policy of honesty, or the advantages of
temperance and perseverance, by which I worked my way
upwards, until, after meriting the confidence of an excellent
master, I found myself enjoying it fully. To his business I
succeeded at his death, having several years before, with his
sanction, married a young and deserving woman, about my
own age, of whose prudence and skill in household matters I
had long had a daily experience. In the subordinate character<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_525" id="Page_525">[525]</a></span>
of his sole domestic servant, in which she figured when I
first knew her, she had but few opportunities of displaying
her intellectual qualities, but when she rose in the world, and
felt the cheering influence of prosperity, her mind, like a
balloon soaring into regions where the bright sun beams on
it, expanded, and she became, as she remains, the kind unsophisticated
partner of my sorrows and my pleasures, the
friend of my heart, and the guiding-star of my destinies.</p>

<p>To be brief, Providence blessed my efforts and increased
my means; I became a wholesale dealer in everything, from
barrels of gunpowder down to pickled herrings; in the civic
acceptation of the word I was a merchant, amongst the vulgar
I am called a drysalter. I accumulated wealth; with my
fortune my family also grew, and one male Scropps, and four
female ditto, grace my board at least once in every week;
for I hold it an article of faith to have a sirloin of roasted beef
upon my table on Sundays, and all my children round me to
partake of it: this may be prejudice&mdash;no matter&mdash;so long as
he could afford it, my poor father did so before me; I plead
that precedent, and am not ashamed of the custom.</p>

<p>Passing over the minor gradations of my life, the removal
from one residence to another, the enlargement of this warehouse,
the rebuilding of that, the anxiety of a canvass for
common councilman, activity in the company of which I am
liveryman, inquests, and vestries, and ward meetings, and all
the other pleasing toils to which an active citizen is subject,
let us come at once to the first marked epoch of my life&mdash;the
year of my Shrievalty. The announcement of my nomination
and election filled Mrs. S. with delight; and when I
took my children to Great Queen Street, Lincoln's Inn Fields,
to look at the gay chariot brushing up for me, I confess I felt
proud and happy to be able to show my progeny the arms of
London, those of the Spectacle-makers' Company, and those
of the Scroppses (recently found at a trivial expense) all
figuring upon the same panels. They looked magnificent
upon the pea-green ground, and the wheels, "white picked-out<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_526" id="Page_526">[526]</a></span>
crimson," looked so chaste, and the hammercloth, and
the fringe, and the festoons, and the Scropps' crests all looked
so rich, and the silk linings and white tassels, and the squabs
and the yellow cushions and the crimson carpet looked so
comfortable, that, as I stood contemplating the equipage, I
said to myself, "What have I done to deserve <em>this</em>? O that
my poor father were alive to see his boy Jack going to
Westminster, to chop sticks and count hobnails, in a carriage
like this!" My children were like mad things; and in the
afternoon, when I put on my first new brown court suit
(lined, like my chariot, with white silk), and fitted up with cut
steel buttons, just to try the effect, it all appeared like a
dream; the sword, which I tried on, every night for half an
hour after I went up to bed, to practise walking with it, was
very inconvenient at first; but use is second nature; and so
by rehearsing and rehearsing I made myself perfect before
that auspicious day, when Sheriffs flourish and geese prevail&mdash;namely,
the twenty-ninth of September.</p>

<p>The twelve months which followed were very delightful,
for, independently of the <em>positive</em> honour and <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">éclat</i> they produced,
I had the Mayoralty in <em>prospectu</em> (having attained my
aldermanic gown by an immense majority the preceding year),
and as I used during the sessions to sit in my box at the Old
Bailey, with my bag at my back and my bouquet on my book,
my thoughts were wholly devoted to one object of contemplation;
culprits stood trembling to hear the verdict of a jury,
and I regarded them not; convicts knelt to receive the fatal
fiat of the Recorder, and I heeded not their sufferings, as I
watched the Lord Mayor seated in the centre of the bench,
with the sword of justice stuck up in a goblet over his head&mdash;there,
thought I, if I live two years, shall <em>I</em> sit&mdash;however,
even as it was, it was very agreeable. When executions, the
chief drawbacks to my delight, happened, I found, after a
little seasoning, I took the thing coolly, and enjoyed my toast
and tea after the patients were turned off, just as if nothing
had happened; for, in <em>my</em> time, we hanged at eight and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_527" id="Page_527">[527]</a></span>
breakfasted at a quarter after, so that without much hurry we
were able to finish our muffins just in time for the cutting
down at nine. I had to go to the House of Commons with a
petition, and to Court with an address&mdash;trying situation for
one of the Scroppses&mdash;however, the want of state in Parliament,
and the very little attention paid to us by the members,
put me quite at my ease at Westminster; while the gracious
urbanity of our accomplished monarch<a name="FNanchor_75" id="FNanchor_75"></a><a href="#Footnote_75" class="fnanchor">[75]</a> on his throne made
me equally comfortable at St. James's. Still I was but a secondary
person, or rather only one of two secondary persons&mdash;the
chief of bailiffs and principal Jack Ketch; there <em>was</em> a
step to gain&mdash;and, as I often mentioned to Mrs. Scropps,
I was sure my heart would never be still until I had reached
the pinnacle.</p>

<p>Behold at length the time arrived! Guildhall crowded to
excess&mdash;the hustings thronged&mdash;the aldermen retire&mdash;they
return&mdash;their choice is announced to the people&mdash;it has
fallen upon John Ebenezer Scropps, Esq. Alderman and
spectacle-maker&mdash;a sudden shout is heard&mdash;"Scropps for
ever!" resounds&mdash;the whole assembly seems to vanish from
my sight&mdash;I come forward&mdash;am invested with the chain&mdash;I
bow&mdash;make a speech&mdash;tumble over the train of the Recorder,
and tread upon the tenderest toe of Mr. Deputy Pod&mdash;leave
the hall in ecstasy, and drive home to Mrs. Scropps in a state
of mind bordering upon insanity.</p>

<p>The days wore on, each one seemed as long as a week,
until at length the 8th of November arrived, and then did
it seem certain that I should be Lord Mayor&mdash;I was sworn
in&mdash;the civic insignia were delivered to me&mdash;I returned them
to the proper officers&mdash;my chaplain was near me&mdash;the
esquires of my household were behind me&mdash;the thing was
done&mdash;never shall I forget the tingling sensation I felt in my
ear when I was first called "My Lord"&mdash;I even doubted if
it were addressed to me, and hesitated to answer&mdash;but it
<em>was</em> so&mdash;the reign of splendour had begun, and after going<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_528" id="Page_528">[528]</a></span>
through the accustomed ceremonies, I got home and retired
to bed early, in order to be fresh for the fatigues of the
ensuing day.</p>

<p>Sleep I did not&mdash;how was it to be expected?&mdash;some part
of the night I was in consultation with Mrs. Scropps upon
the different arrangements; settling about the girls, their
places at the banquet, and their partners at the ball; the
wind down the chimney sounded like the shouts of the
people; the cocks crowing in the mews at the back of the
house I took for trumpets sounding my approach; and the
ordinary incidental noises in the family I fancied the popguns
at Stangate, announcing my disembarkation at Westminster&mdash;thus
I tossed and tumbled until the long wished-for day
dawned, and I jumped up anxiously to realize the visions of
the night. I was not long at my toilet&mdash;I was soon shaved
and dressed&mdash;but just as I was settling myself comfortably
into my beautiful brown broadcloth inexpressibles, crack
went something, and I discovered that a seam had ripped
half a foot long. Had it been consistent with the dignity of
a Lord Mayor to swear, I should, I believe, at that moment,
have anathematized the offending tailor;&mdash;as it was, what
was to be done?&mdash;I heard trumpets in earnest, carriages
drawing up and setting down; sheriffs and chaplains, mace
bearers, train bearers, sword bearers, water bailiffs, remembrancers,
Mr. Common Hunt, the town clerk, and the deputy
town clerk, all bustling about&mdash;the bells ringing&mdash;and <em>I</em>
late, with a hole in my inexpressibles! There was but one
remedy&mdash;my wife's maid, kind, intelligent creature, civil and
obliging, and ready to turn her hand to anything, came to
my aid, and in less than fifteen minutes her activity, exerted
in the midst of the confusion, repaired the injury, and turned
me out fit to be seen by the whole corporation of London.</p>

<p>When I was dressed, I tapped at Mrs. Scropps's door,
went in, and asked her if she thought I should do; the
dear soul, after settling my point-lace frill (which she had
been good enough to pick off her own petticoat on purpose)<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_529" id="Page_529">[529]</a></span>
and putting my bag straight, gave me the sweetest salute
imaginable.</p>

<p>"I wish your Lordship health and happiness," said she.</p>

<p>"Sally," said I, "your Ladyship is an angel;" and so,
having kissed each of my daughters, who were in progress
of dressing, I descended the stairs, to begin the auspicious
day in which I reached the apex of my greatness. Never
shall I forget the bows&mdash;the civilities&mdash;the congratulations&mdash;Sheriffs
bending before me&mdash;the Recorder smiling&mdash;the
Common Serjeant at my feet&mdash;the pageant was intoxicating;
and when, after having breakfasted, I stepped into that
glazed and gilded house upon wheels, called the stage coach,
and saw my sword-bearer pop himself into one of the boots,
with the sword of state in his hands, I was lost in ecstasy.
I threw myself back upon the seat of the vehicle, with all
possible dignity, but not without damage; for, in my efforts
at ease and elegance, I snapped off the cut steel hilt of my
own rapier, by accidentally bumping the whole weight of
my body right, or rather wrong, directly upon the top of it.</p>

<p>But what was a sword hilt and a bruise to <em>me</em>&mdash;pride
knows no pain&mdash;I felt none&mdash;I was <em>the</em> Lord Mayor, the
greatest man in the greatest city of the greatest nation in
the world. The people realised my expectation; and
"Bravo! Scropps," and "Scropps for ever!" resounded
again and again, as we proceeded slowly and majestically
towards the river, through a fog which prevented our being
advantageously seen, and which got down the throat of the
sword-bearer, who was a little troubled with asthma, and
who coughed incessantly during our progress, much to my
annoyance, not to speak of the ungraceful movements which
his convulsive barkings gave to the red velvet scabbard of
the honourable glaive, as it stuck out of the coach window.</p>

<p>We embarked in <em>my</em> barge. A new scene of splendour
here awaited me: guns, flags, banners, in short, every thing
that taste and fancy could suggest, or a water-bailiff provide,
were awaiting me. In the gilded bark was a cold collation.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_530" id="Page_530">[530]</a></span>
I ate, or tried to eat, but I tasted nothing. Fowls, pâtees,
game, beef, ham&mdash;all had the same flavour; champagne,
hock, and Madeira, were all alike to me. "Lord Mayor"
was all I saw, all I heard, all I swallowed; every thing was
pervaded and absorbed by the one captivating word; and
the repeated appeals to "My Lordship" were sweeter than
nectar.</p>

<p>Well, sir, at Westminster I was presented and received;
and what do you think I then did&mdash;I, John Ebenezer
Scropps, of Coventry?&mdash;I desired the Recorder to invite
the Judges to dine with me at the Guildhall!&mdash;I, who
remember when two of the oldest and most innocent of
the twelve came the circuit, trembling at the very sight
of them, and believing them some extraordinary creatures,
upon whom all the hair and fur, that I saw, grew
naturally; I not only asked these formidable beings to
dine with me, but, as if I thought it beneath my dignity
to do so in my own proper person, actually deputed a judge
of my own to do it for me. I never shall forget their lordships'
bows in return; mandarins on a mantelpiece are fools
to them.</p>

<p>Then came the return. We re-embarked; and then, in
reality, did I hear the guns at Stangate saluting me. I stood
it like a man, although I have always a fear of accidents
from the wadding. The tide was with us; we soon reached
Blackfriars' Bridge; we landed once more in the sphere of
my greatness. At the corner of Fleet Street was the Lady
Mayoress, waiting for the procession; there she was, Sally
Scropps&mdash;my own Sally&mdash;(her maiden name was Snob,)&mdash;with
a plume of feathers that half filled the coach, and young
Sally, and Jenny, and Maria, all crammed in the front seat,
with their backs to <em>my</em> horses, which were pawing the mud,
and snorting, and smoking like steam-engines, with nostrils
like safety-valves; not to speak of four of my footmen
hanging behind the carriage, like bees in a swarm. There
had not been so much riband in my family since my poor<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_531" id="Page_531">[531]</a></span>
father's failure at Coventry; and yet, how often, over and
over again, although the poor old man had been dead more
than twenty years, did I during that morning, in the midst
of my splendour, think of <em>him</em>, and wish to my heart that
he could see me in my greatness. Even in the midst of
my triumph, I seemed to defer to my good kind parent&mdash;in
heaven, as I hope and trust&mdash;as if I were anxious for <em>his</em>
judgment, and <em>his</em> opinion, as to how I should perform the
manifold arduous duties of the day.</p>

<p>Up Ludgate Hill we went&mdash;the fog grew thicker and
thicker&mdash;but then the beautiful women at the windows&mdash;those
high up could only just see my knees, and the paste
buckles in my shoes. This I regretted; but every now and
then I bowed condescendingly to the people, in order to
show my courtesy, and my chain and collar, which I had
discovered during the morning shone the brighter for being
shaken. But else I maintained a proper dignity throughout
my progress; and, although I said an occasional word or
two to my chaplain, and smiled occasionally at Mr. Water-bailiff,
I took no more notice of Mr. Sword and Mr. Mace,
than I should have taken of Gog and Magog.</p>

<p>At length we reached Guildhall. As I crossed that
beautiful building, lighted brilliantly, and filled with splendidly
dressed company, and heard the deafening shouts
which pealed through its roof as I entered it, I felt a good
deal flurried. I retired to a private room, adjusted my dress,
shook out my frill, rubbed up my chain and collar, and
prepared to receive my guests. They came, and shall I
ever forget it? Dinner was announced; the bands played
"Oh! the roast beef of Old England." Onwards we went.
A prince of the blood&mdash;of the blood royal of my own
country&mdash;led out Sally&mdash;my own Sally&mdash;the Lady Mayoress;
the Lord Chancellor handed out young Sally&mdash;I saw it done&mdash;I
thought I should have fainted; the Prime Minister took
Maria; the Lord Privy Seal gave his arm to Jenny; and
Mrs. Snob, my wife's mother&mdash;a wonderful woman at her<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_532" id="Page_532">[532]</a></span>
age, bating her corpulency&mdash;was escorted to table by the
Right Honourable the Lord Chief Justice of the King's
Bench, in his full robes and collar of SS. Oh, if my poor
father could have but seen <em>that</em>!</p>

<p>At the ball, my eldest girl danced with the Secretary of
State for Foreign Affairs, and found him very chatty, though
a bit of a "swell;" Maria danced with the Lord Privy Seal;
and my youngest with a very handsome man, who wore a
riband and star, but who he was, we none of us could ever
find out; no matter&mdash;never did I see such a day, although
it was but the first of three hundred and sixty-five splendid
visions.</p>

<p>It would be tedious to expatiate in detail upon all the
pleasures of this happy year, thus auspiciously begun. Each
month brought its fresh pleasures; each week its new
amusements; each day its festival. Public meetings, under
the sanction of the Right Honourable the Lord Mayor; concerts
and balls, under the patronage of the Lady Mayoress.
Then came Easter, and its dinner&mdash;Blue-coat boys and buns;
then to St. Paul's one Sunday, and to some other church
another Sunday. And then came summer; and then there
was swan-hopping <em>up</em> the river, and white-baiting <em>down</em> the
river; Crown and Sceptre below, navigation barge above;
music, flags, streamers, guns, and company. Turtle every
day in the week; peas a pound per pint, and grapes a guinea
a pound; not to speak of dabbling in rose-water, served in
gold, nor the loving cup, nor the esquires of my household,
all in full dress at my elbow.</p>

<p>The days, which before had seemed weeks, were now
turned to minutes; scarcely had I swallowed my breakfast,
when I was in the justice room; and before I had mittimused
half a dozen paupers for begging about the streets, luncheon
was ready; this hardly over, in comes a despatch or a
deputation; and so on till dinner, which was barely ended
before supper was announced. We all became delighted
with the Mansion House. My girls grew graceful by the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_533" id="Page_533">[533]</a></span>
new confidence their high station gave them; Maria refused
a good offer because her lover had an ugly name; and my
dearest Sarah was absolutely persecuted by Sir Patrick
O'Donahoo, who had what is called the run of the house,
and who scarcely ever dined out of it during my mayoralty,
whether I was at home or not. What did it matter?
There was plenty to eat and drink; the money must be
spent, and the victuals cooked; and so as we made ourselves
happy, it was of no great consequence having one or two
more or less at table. We got used to the place&mdash;the
establishment had got used to us; we became, in fact, easy
in our dignity, and happy in our state, when, lo and behold,
the ninth of another November came&mdash;the anniversary of
my exaltation&mdash;the conclusion of my reign.</p>

<p>Again did we go to Guildhall; again were we toasted
and addressed; again we were handed in and led out; the
girls again flirted with Cabinet ministers, and danced with
ambassadors; and at two o'clock in the morning drove home
from the scene of gaiety to our old residence in Budge Row,
Walbrook. Never in this world did pickled herrings and
turpentine smell so powerfully as when we entered the house
upon that occasion; and although my wife and the young
ones stuck to the drinkables at Guildhall as long as was
decent, in order to keep up their spirits, their natural
feelings would have way, and a sort of shuddering disgust
seemed to fill all their minds on their return home. The
passage looked so narrow, the drawing-room looked so small,
the staircase was so dark, and the ceilings were so low.
However, being tired, we all slept well&mdash;at least, I did; for
I was in no humour to talk; and the only topic I could
think upon, before I dropped off, was a calculation of the
amount of expenses which I had incurred during the just
expired year of my magnificence.</p>

<p>In the morning we assembled at breakfast; a note which
had arrived by the twopenny post lay on the table; it was
addressed "Mrs. Scropps, Budge Row." The girls, one after<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_534" id="Page_534">[534]</a></span>
another, took it up, read the undignified superscription, and
laid it down again. My old and excellent friend Bucklesbury
called to inquire after us. What were his first words?&mdash;they
<em>were</em> the first I had heard from a stranger since my
change;&mdash;"Well, Scropps, how are you, old boy? Done
up, eh?"</p>

<p>"Scropps&mdash;old boy"&mdash;no deference, no respect, no "My
lord, I hope your lordship passed a comfortable night; and
how is her ladyship, and your lordship's amiable daughters?"
not a bit of it&mdash;"How's Mrs. S. and the <em>gals</em>?" There was
nothing in this; it was quite natural&mdash;all as it <em>had</em> been&mdash;all
as it must be&mdash;all as it should be; but how very unlike
what it <em>was</em> only one day before! The very servants themselves,
who, when amidst the strapping, state-fed, lace-loaded
lackeys of the Mansion House (transferred, with the
chairs and tables, from one lord mayor to another), dared
not speak, nor look, nor say their lives were their own,
strutted about, and banged the doors, and talked of their
"missis," as if she had been an apple-woman.</p>

<p>So much for domestic matters. I went out&mdash;I was
shoved about in Cheapside, in the most remorseless manner,
by the money-hunting crowd. My right eye had the narrowest
possible escape of being poked out by the tray of a
brawny butcher-boy, who, when I civilly remonstrated,
turned round and said, "Vy, I say, who are you, I vonder,
as is so partiklar about your <em>hye-sight</em>?" I felt an involuntary
shudder. "Who am I?&mdash;to-day," thought I, "I <em>am</em> John
Ebenezer Scropps; two days ago I <em>was</em> Lord Mayor of
London;" and so the rencontre ended, evidently to the advantage
of the bristly brute. It was, however, too much
for me. I admit the weakness; but the effect of contrast
was too powerful&mdash;the change was too sudden&mdash;and I
determined to go to Brighton for a few weeks to refresh
myself and be weaned from my dignity.</p>

<p>We went&mdash;we drove to the Royal Hotel; in the hall
stood one of his Majesty's ministers, one of my former<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_535" id="Page_535">[535]</a></span>
guests, speaking to his lady and daughter: my girls passed
close to him,&mdash;he had handed one of them to dinner the
year before, but he appeared entirely to have forgotten her.
By-and-by, when we were going out in a fly to take the air,
one of the waiters desired the fly-man to pull off, because
Sir Something Somebody's carriage could not come up,&mdash;it
was clear that the name of Scropps had lost its influence.</p>

<p>We secluded ourselves in a private house, where we did
nothing but sigh and look at the sea. We had been totally
spoiled for our proper sphere, and could not get into a better;
the indifference of our inferiors mortified us, and the
familiarity of our equals disgusted us,&mdash;our potentiality was
gone, and we were so much degraded that a puppy of a
fellow had the impertinence to ask Jenny if she was going to
one of the Old Ship balls. "Of course," said the coxcomb,
"I don't mean the 'Almacks,' for they are uncommonly
select."</p>

<p>In short, do what we would, go where we might, we were
outraged and annoyed, or, at least, thought ourselves so;
and beyond all bitterness was the reflection that the days of
our dignity and delight never might return. There were at
Brighton no less than three men who called me Jack, and
<em>that</em>, out of flies or in libraries, and one of these chose
occasionally, by way of making himself particularly agreeable,
to address me by the familiar appellation of Jacky.
At length, and that only three weeks after my fall, an over-grown
tallow-chandler met us on the Steyne, and stopped
our party to observe, "as how he thought he owed me for
two barrels of coal-tar, for doing over his pig-styes." This
settled it,&mdash;we departed from Brighton, and made a tour of
the coast; but we never rallied, and business, which must
be minded, drove us before Christmas to Budge Row, where
we are again settled down.</p>

<p>Maria has grown thin&mdash;Sarah has turned Methodist&mdash;and
Jenny, who danced with his Excellency the Portuguese
Ambassador, who was called angelic by the Right Honourable<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_536" id="Page_536">[536]</a></span>
the Lord Privy Seal; and who, moreover, refused a man of
fortune because he had an ugly name, is going to be married
to Lieutenant Stodge, on the half-pay of the Royal Marines&mdash;and
what then? I am sure if it were not for the females
of my family I should be perfectly at my ease in my proper
sphere, out of which the course of our civic constitution
raised me. It was very pleasant at first&mdash;but I have toiled
long and laboured hard; I have done my duty, and Providence
has blessed my works. If we were discomposed at
the sudden change in our station, I it is who was to blame,
for having aspired to honours which I knew were not to last.
However, the ambition was not dishonourable, nor did I disgrace
the station while I held it. Indeed, I ought to apologize
for making public the weakness by which we were all
affected; especially as I have myself already learned to
laugh at what we all severely felt at first&mdash;the miseries of a
<span class="smcap">Splendid Annual</span>.</p>

<h3>THE BERNERS-STREET HOAX.</h3>

<p class="center">(1809.)</p>

<p class="drop-capx">In walking down Berners Street one day, his companion
called Hook's attention to the particularly neat and
modest appearance of a house, the residence, as appeared
from the door-plate, of some decent shopkeeper's widow.
"I'll lay you a guinea," said Theodore, "that in one week
that nice modest dwelling shall be the most famous in all
London." The bet was taken&mdash;in the course of four or five
days Hook had written and despatched <em>one thousand</em> letters,
conveying orders to tradesmen of every sort within the bills
of mortality, all to be executed on one particular day, and
as nearly as possible at one fixed hour. From waggons of
coals and potatoes to books, prints, feathers, ices, jellies,
and cranberry tarts&mdash;nothing in any way whatever available
to any human being but was commanded from scores
of rival dealers scattered over our "province of bricks," from
Wapping to Lambeth, from Whitechapel to Paddington. In
1809 Oxford Road was not approachable either from Westminster,
or Mayfair, or from the City, otherwise than through
a complicated series of lanes. It may be feebly and afar off<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_540" id="Page_540">[540]</a></span>
guessed what the crash and jam and tumult of that day was.
Hook had provided himself with a lodging nearly opposite
the fated No. &mdash;&mdash;; and there, with a couple of trusty allies,
he watched the development of the mid-day melodrame. But
some of the dramatis personæ were seldom if ever alluded to
in later times. He had no objection to bodying forth the
arrival of the lord mayor and his chaplain, invited to take
the death-bed confession of a peculating common councilman;
but he would rather have buried in oblivion that precisely the
same sort of liberty was taken with the Governor of the Bank,
the chairman of the East India Company, a lord chief justice,
a Cabinet minister,&mdash;above all, with the Archbishop of Canterbury,
and his Royal Highness the Commander-in-Chief.
They all obeyed the summons&mdash;every pious and patriotic
feeling had been most movingly appealed to; we are not sure
that they all reached Berners Street: but the Duke of York's
military punctuality and crimson liveries brought him to the
point of attack before the poor widow's astonishment had
risen to terror and despair. Perhaps no assassination, no
conspiracy, no royal demise or ministerial revolution of recent
times was a greater godsend to the newspapers than this
audacious piece of mischief. In Hook's own theatrical world
he was instantly suspected, but no sign escaped either him
or his confidants. The affair was beyond that circle a serious
one. Fierce were the growlings of the doctors and surgeons,
scores of whom had been cheated of valuable hours. Attorneys,
teachers of all kinds, male and female, hair-dressers,
tailors, popular preachers, and parliamentary philanthropists,
had been victimized in person, and were in their various notes
vociferous. But the tangible material damage done was itself
no joking matter. There had been an awful smashing of
glass, china, harpsichords, and coach-panels. Many a horse
had fallen never to rise again. Beer-barrels and wine-barrels
had been overturned and exhausted with impunity amidst
the press of countless multitudes. It had been a fine field-day
for the pickpockets. There arose a fervent hue and cry
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_541" id="Page_541">[541]</a></span>for the detection of the wholesale deceiver and destroyer.</p>

<div class="caption">THE BERNERS STREET HOAX.</div>
</div>

<p>Mr. Theodore found it convenient to be laid up for a week
or two by a severe fit of illness, and then promoted re-convalescence
by a country tour. He is said to have on this
occasion revisited Oxford, and professed an intention of at
length commencing residence under the discipline of Alma
Mater. But if this was so, it went no farther; by-and-by
the storm blew over, as it would have done had Berners Street
been burnt to the ground, and the Lord Mayor's coach blown
up with all its cargo&mdash;and the Great Unknown re-appeared
with tranquillity in the Green Room.</p>

<p>The gambol once shown, it was imitated <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">ad nauseam</i> in
many English towns, and also in Paris, with numberless unmeritorious
variations. Gilbert Gurney expresses high scorn
of these plagiarists.</p>


<hr class="r15" />
<h3>ROMEO COATES.</h3>

<p>Some two or three years later Hook performed another
hoax more limited in scale, but to our mind quite as inexcusable.
The Regent gave a fête of surpassing magnificence
at Carlton House, on the 17th of June. Romeo Coates was
then in his glory&mdash;murdering Shakspeare at the Haymarket,
and driving the bright pink cockle-shell with the life-large
chanticleers in gilt brass about the streets and park. Theodore,
who could imitate any handwriting, contrived to get one of
the Chamberlain's tickets into his possession for an hour,
and produced a facsimile commanding the presence of Signor
Romeo. He then equipped himself in some scarlet uniform,
and delivered in person the flattering missive. The delight
of Romeo must be imagined. Hook was in attendance when
the time for his sallying forth arrived, and had the satisfaction
of seeing him swing into his chariot bedizened in all<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_542" id="Page_542">[542]</a></span>
his finery, with a diamond-hilted sword and the air of Louis
le Grand. The line of carriages being an Alexandrine,
Theodore was also by the "care colonne" when the amateur's
vehicle reached its point&mdash;saw him mount up the stair and
enter the vestibule. The stranger, it is known, passed into
the interior without remark or question; but when he had
to show his ticket to the Private Secretary, that eye caught
the imposture. Mr. Coates was politely informed that a
mistake had occurred, and had to retrace his steps to the
portico. The blazoned chariot had driven off: in wrath
and confusion he must pick his steps as he might to the
first stand of hackney-coaches. Hook was at his elbow, well
muffled up. No such discomfiture since the Knight of the
Woful Countenance was unhorsed by the Bachelor Sampson
Carrasco. We must not omit to say that the Prince, when
aware of what had occurred, signified extreme regret that
any one of his household should have detected the trick, or
acted on its detection. Mr. Coates was, as he said, an
inoffensive gentleman, and his presence might have amused
many of the guests, and could have done harm to no one.
His Royal Highness sent his Secretary next morning to
apologize in person, and to signify that as the arrangements
and ornaments were still entire, he hoped Mr. Coates would
come and look at them. And Romeo went. In this performance
Hook had no confidant. To do him justice, he
never told the story without some signs of compunction.</p>

<h3>HOOK, MATHEWS, AND THE ALDERMAN.</h3>

<p>No mirth in this world ever surpassed the fascination of
these early mountebankeries. We have seen austere judges,
venerable prelates, grand lords, and superfine ladies, all alike
overwhelmed and convulsed as he went over the minutest
details of such an episode as that, for example, of his and
Mathews, as they were rowing to Richmond, being suddenly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_543" id="Page_543">[543]</a></span>

approach of the napkined alderman&mdash;the comedians' cool,
indifferent reception of him, and his indignant inquiries&mdash;the
gradual announcement of their being the agents of the

old gentleman's pleasaunce&mdash;his alarm and horror, which
call forth the unaffected regrets and commiserations of the
unfortunate officials, "who are never more pained than with
such a duty"&mdash;the alderman's suggestion that they had better
walk in and talk the matter over&mdash;their anxious examination
of watches, and reluctant admission that they might spare a

<h3>A STRANGE DINNER.</h3>

<p>Of Hook's pursuits at the Mauritius, few particulars, save
those given in the letter to Mathews, have reached us: they
were probably not far dissimilar in spirit from those in which
he had indulged at home; at least, an anecdote or two corroborative
of the "<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">solum non animum mutant</i>," etc., which
we have heard him relate, would lead to such an inference.
One of these bore reference to the reception with which a
respectable family, that had been recommended to his notice
by some common friend in England, was greeted on its
arrival at the island. Hook was, of course, all kindness and
hospitality&mdash;an invitation to La Réduite, a country retreat
belonging to the Governor, and at which the Treasurer also
occasionally resided, was immediately forwarded to the
strangers. Equally, as a matter of course, their agreeable
host took upon himself the task of "lionizing" the neighbourhood;
and more especially of pointing out to their
observation the beauties, architectural and otherwise, of
Port Louis.</p>

<p>For this purpose, the morning following that of debarcation
was selected. The town at that period, and it has received
but few additions since, was of moderate extent, stretching
something in the shape of an amphitheatre almost three
miles along the coast, and bounded inland at a distance
scarcely exceeding half a mile, by an open space called the
"Champ de Mars." Along this narrow slip, the streets of
which are straight and laid out at right angles after the
French fashion, did Mr. Hook conduct his new acquaintances;
up one lane, down another, along the Rue Marengo, by the
Government House, backwards and forwards, right and left,
till every building of the least pretensions to importance had
been visited by every possible mode of approach, and on
each occasion honoured with a different name and fresh
history. The Joss House was multiplied by six; the old<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_545" id="Page_545">[545]</a></span>
East India Company barracks did duty for public asylums
for lunatics, or private residences of the Queen of Madagascar;
churches, prisons, the Royal College and theatre,
were examined again and again, and so on till the miserable
party, completely fatigued with the extreme heat, and seeing
no symptoms of a termination to the walk, pleaded inability
to proceed. One ventured to observe, that though of a
much greater size than the view from the harbour would
have led him to suppose, the town exhibited a singular sameness
of style in the principal edifices. "A natural thing
enough in an infant colony," suggested Hook.</p>

<p>The prospect of a luxurious "tiffin" which was awaiting
their return, served in some manner to restore the spirits of
the travellers, and they took their seats with a full determination
of doing ample justice to the far-famed delicacies of
the island. The first course presented to the eyes of the
astonished but still unsuspecting strangers, comprised nearly
every species of <em>un</em>eatable that could be got together. An
enormous gourd graced the centre of the table, strange de-appetizing
dishes were placed around, and in turn pressed
upon the attention of the guests.</p>

<p>"Allow me to offer you a little cat-curry," exclaimed the
host; "there is an absurd prejudice against these things in
Europe, I know, but <em>this</em> I can really recommend; or, perhaps,
you would prefer a little devilled monkey; that is, I
believe, a dish of fried snakes opposite you, Mr. J&mdash;&mdash;."</p>

<p>Mr. J&mdash;&mdash; recoiled in alarm.</p>

<p>"Hand those lizards round, they seem particularly fine."</p>

<p>Nastiness after nastiness was proffered in vain; the
perplexed Cockneys struggled hard to maintain a decent
composure, but with difficulty kept their ground before the
unsavoury abominations. What was to be done?&mdash;it was
clearly the <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">cuisine de pays</i>, and the host appeared evidently
distressed at their want of appreciation of his fare. One
gentleman at length, in sheer despair, thought he "<em>would</em>
just try a lizard."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_546" id="Page_546">[546]</a></span></p>

<p>"Pray do so," eagerly returned Hook; "you will find
the flavour a little peculiar at first, I daresay; but it is
astonishing how soon it becomes pleasant to the palate."</p>

<p>But however rapidly a taste for the saurian delicacy
might be acquired, the adventurous individual in question
was not destined to make the experiment. In endeavouring
to help himself to one of those unpromising dainties, the
tail became separated from its body&mdash;it was too much for
his nerve&mdash;turning a little pale, he pushed aside his plate,
and begged to be excused. Since the celebrated "feast
after the manner of the ancients," such a collation had never
been put down before hungry men: the jest, however, was
not pushed to extremes, a second course succeeded; and on
the choice viands of which it consisted the guests proceeded
to fall with what appetite they might.</p>

<p>Equally absurd, though perhaps hardly becoming the
dignity of a treasurer and accountant-general, was a piece
of pleasantry played off at the expense of the authorities
of the island! It was on the occasion of a public dinner
given at the Government House, and at which the governor
himself, confined by ill health to his country residence,
was unable to be present. The officer next in rank was,
therefore, called upon to preside; but whether from the
soup, or the fish, or the cucumber&mdash;if there happened to
be any&mdash;disagreeing with him, or from whatever cause, he
was compelled to quit the banquet at an early hour, and
was conveyed, utterly incapable of either giving or receiving
any command, to his quarters. The task of occupying the
chair, and proposing the remainder of the loyal and usual
toasts, now devolved on Hook; and, as each separate health
was given and duly signalled, it was responded to by an
immediate salute from a battery in the square below, according
to special orders. The appointed list having been gone
through, the greater portion of the company departed; but
the chairman, so far from showing any disposition to quit
his post, begged gentlemen "to fill their glasses, and drink<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_547" id="Page_547">[547]</a></span>
a bumper to that gallant and distinguished officer, Captain
Dobbs,"&mdash;up went the signal&mdash;bang! bang! bang! roared
the artillery. "Lieutenant Hobbs" followed, with the same
result. "Ensign Snobbs," and bang! bang! bang! greeted
the announcement of his name. Quick as the guns could
be reloaded, up again went the signal, and off went his
Majesty's twenty-fours, to the honour, successively, of every
individual present, soldier or civilian.</p>

<p>In vain the subaltern on duty, who had expected at the
termination of the accustomed formalities to be permitted
to join the party, sent up a remonstrance. The directions
he had received were as imperative as those delivered by
Denmark's king:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<p class="verse6">"Let the kettle to the trumpet speak,</p>
<p class="verse">The trumpet to the cannoneer without,</p>
<p class="verse">The cannon to the heavens&mdash;the heaven to earth."</p>
</div></div></div>

<p class="noindent">Such a bombardment had not been heard since the capture
of the island, and it was not till the noisy compliment had
been paid to cook and scullion, who were summoned from
the kitchen to return thanks <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">in propria personâ</i>, and the
powder as well as patience of the indignant gunners were
exhausted, that the firing ceased. Something in the shape
of a reprimand was talked of; but as, after all, the principal
share of blame was not to be attached to the facetious
deputy, the affair was permitted to rest.</p>


<hr class="r15" />
<h3>LUDICROUS ADVENTURE AT SUNBURY.</h3>

<p>In the course of Hook's numerous suburban excursions, or
possibly during his brief sojourn with Doctor Curtis, at Sunbury,
he had become acquainted with a young lady, a resident
in the neighbourhood, possessed of an amiable disposition
and great personal attractions. Theodore was a favourite<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_548" id="Page_548">[548]</a></span>
both with her family and herself, but her affections, unfortunately,
were fixed upon another. Notwithstanding, however,
the evident preference shown to his rival, the young gentleman
prosecuted his suit with all the ardour and blindness of
eighteen. It was to no purpose that good-humoured hints
were thrown out on the part of his inamorata, that, highly
agreeable as his society could not fail to be, another held
that place in her regards for which he was in vain contending.
He determined to set all upon a single cast, and to
throw himself, and whatever loose silver might be remaining
from the proceeds of his last operetta, at the fair one's feet.</p>

<p>On the day fixed for the final appeal, he found the ground
already in the occupation of the enemy; and it was not till
towards the close of the evening that an opportunity was to
be snatched of making a formal proposal for the lady's hand:
as might have been expected, it was declined, firmly but
kindly; and off rushed the rejected swain, in a frenzy of
rage, to his hotel, whither&mdash;for the little village in those days
boasted but of one&mdash;he was soon followed by the successful
candidate, Mr. P&mdash;&mdash;.</p>

<p>It so happened that, in addition to the <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">contretemps</i> of being
lodged beneath the same roof, the rivals actually occupied
adjoining chambers, and were separated from each other
merely by a thin boarded partition: everything that passed
in one apartment was consequently pretty distinctly audible
in the next; and the first sounds that greeted Mr. P&mdash;&mdash;
on his arrival were certain strong objurgations and maledictions,
in which his own name was constantly recurring, and
which proceeded from the neighbouring room. Every now
and then a boot-jack or a clothes-brush was hurled against
the wall; next a noise would be heard as of a portmanteau
being kicked across the floor, accompanied by such epithets
as might be supposed most galling and appropriate to a discomfited
foe. Then a pause&mdash;a burst of lamentation or an
attempt at irony&mdash;then again more invectives, more railing,
more boot-jacks, and so on for half the night did the hapless<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_549" id="Page_549">[549]</a></span>
lover continue to bewail the bad taste of women in general,
and the especial want of discernment in his own mistress;
and to heap bitter abuse and inflict imaginary chastisement
upon the person of his more favoured opponent.</p>

<p>Mr. P&mdash;&mdash; was a Welshman, and for a moment the hot
blood of the Tudors and Llewellyns bubbled up; but "cool
reflection at length came across:" the irresistible absurdity
of the position struck with full force upon a mind rendered
more than usually complacent by the agreeable assurances so
lately received, and he threw himself on the bed in a fit of
perfectly Homeric laughter. Early on the next morning
Hook started for town; but whether he ever learnt the
perilous vicinity in which he had passed the few preceding
hours, we know not. The anecdote reached us from a
different quarter.</p>

<p>During this period he was not so thoroughly engrossed by
the anxieties of love, but that he found time and sufficient
spirits for the indulgence of those lively pleasantries, which
must doubtless have contributed much to recommend him
to the favour of the lady's guardian, if not to her own.
The name of the inn, "The Flower Pot," which was the
scene of the absurd adventure just related, suggested one
of these. There resided, it seems, at Sunbury, in a large
house, an elderly gentleman, a bachelor, of somewhat
eccentric disposition, whose ruling passion was for his
garden. This, albeit prodigality was by no means a besetting
sin of the proprietor, was kept in the most admirable order,
and decorated, regardless of expense, with a profusion of
ornaments in the very height of suburban fashion&mdash;leaden
cupids, slate sun-dials, grottoes of oyster-shells and looking-glass,
heaps of flints and overburned bricks, denominated
rockwork, and beyond all, and above all, with a magnificent
vase filled with a flaming cluster of fuchsias, geraniums,
and a number of plants with brilliant blossoms and unutterable
names, which faced the entrance. Here, one fine afternoon,
when the flowers had reached their acme of refulgence,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_550" id="Page_550">[550]</a></span>
Mr. Theodore pulled up his dennet. A powerful tug at the
bell brought a sort of half-gardener, half-groom, to the gate
in double-quick time.</p>

<p>"Take the mare round to the stable, put her in a loose
box, and rub her down well. I'll come and see her fed
myself in a few minutes; none of you rascals are to be
trusted!"</p>

<p>So saying, the young gentleman threw the reins to the
domestic, marched leisurely along the broad, brown-sugar-looking
walk, dexterously cutting off here and there an
overgrown carnation with the lash of his driving-whip, and
entered the hall. Giving another tremendous jerk to the
bell-wire in passing, he walked into the dining-room, the
door of which happened to be open, took up a magazine,
and threw himself at full length upon the sofa. A tidily-dressed
maid servant appeared at the summons.</p>

<p>"Bring me a glass of brandy-and-water, my dear, and
send 'Boots.'"</p>

<p>"'Boots,' and 'brandy-and-water,'&mdash;La, sir!" exclaimed
the astonished girl.</p>

<p>"You may fetch me a pair of slippers yourself, if you
like; so make haste, and you shall have a kiss when you
come back."</p>

<p>Duped by the authoritative air assumed by the visitor,
(it would be indecorous to suppose another motive,) the
attendant disappeared, and speedily returning with the
slippers, observed,</p>

<p>"If you please, sir, I have brought you a pair, but they
are master's, and he is rather particular."</p>

<p>"Particular! Nonsense! where's the brandy-and-water?"</p>

<p>"He never leaves out the spirits, sir; he always keeps
the key himself, sir, in his own pocket."</p>

<p>"He must be a deuced odd sort of fellow, then: send
him here immediately."</p>

<p>"Master is dressing, sir; he will be down directly,"
was the reply; and, accordingly, after the lapse of a few<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_551" id="Page_551">[551]</a></span>
minutes, Mr. &mdash;&mdash; made his appearance in full evening
costume.</p>

<p>"My good friend," commenced Hook, without raising
his eyes from the paper, "allow me to observe, that the
rules of your establishment are a little inconvenient to
travellers: I have been here above a quarter of an hour,
and have not been able to get so much as a glass of brandy-and-water&mdash;bring
one immediately&mdash;hot; and let me know
what you have got for dinner."</p>

<p>"I really beg your pardon," said old Mr. &mdash;&mdash;, as soon
as he could find words; "I really beg your pardon, but I am
quite at a loss&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"So am I, my good man&mdash;for a glass of brandy-and-water&mdash;bring
that, and another for yourself, and then I
shall be happy to hear whatever you have to say."</p>

<p>"But, sir, you must permit me to state&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I was never in such a detestable house in my life,"
exclaimed Hook, starting up; "what do you stand chattering
there for, instead of attending to my order: am I
to be kept here starving all night? Bring the brandy-and-water,
d'ye hear?"</p>

<p>The old gentleman was struck positively speechless; his
face purpled, he seemed in imminent peril of choking with
the sudden conflux of ire, indignation, and astonishment.</p>

<p>"Why, the fellow's drunk!" pursued Theodore; "disgracefully
drunk, at this time of day! and in his own parlour,
too! I shall feel it my duty, sir, to lay a statement of
this inexcusable conduct before the bench."</p>

<p>Mr. &mdash;&mdash; sprang to the bell. "John&mdash;Thomas&mdash;turn
this impudent scoundrel out of the house!"</p>

<p>The arrival of the servants necessarily led to an explanation.
Nothing could exceed Mr. Hook's regret; what
could be done? what apology could be made? He was
a perfect stranger to Sunbury; had been directed to the
"Flower Pot," as the inn affording the best accommodation;
and, on seeing what he imagined to be a gigantic<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_552" id="Page_552">[552]</a></span>
representation of the sign in question at the garden-gate,
he had naturally entered, and acted upon that erroneous
impression. This was the unkindest cut of all. To find a
stranger reclining in full possession of his sofa and slippers
was bad enough; to be treated as a dilatory innkeeper
was worse; and to be taxed with insolence and intoxication,
was still more trying to a gentleman of respectable character
and excitable nerves; but to hear the highest achievement
of art he possessed&mdash;the admiration of himself and friends,
and the envy of all Sunbury, his darling vase, compared
with which the "Warwick" and the "Barberini" were as
common washpots&mdash;to hear this likened to an alehouse sign,
was a humiliation which dwarfed into insignificance all
preceding insults. But as to whether Hook contrived to
soothe the anger he had provoked, and to win a way, as was
his wont, into the good graces of his victim&mdash;or whether
this last affront proved irremediable, and he was compelled
to seek further entertainment for himself and horse at the
"Flower Pot" minor, unfortunately our informant is at fault.</p>


<hr class="r15" />
<h3>CHARLES MATHEWS AND HOOK.</h3>

<p>It was about the year 1803 that my husband first
became intimate with Mr. Theodore Hook. The election for
Westminster had recently taken place, and Mr. Sheridan was
chosen one of its representatives, on which occasion the
actors of Drury Lane celebrated their proprietor's triumph,
by giving him a dinner at the Piazza coffee-house. To this
dinner Mr. Hook was invited.</p>

<p>In the course of the day many persons sung, and Mr.
Hook being in turn solicited, displayed, to the delight and
surprise of all present, his wondrous talent in extemporaneous
singing. The company was numerous, and generally
strangers to Mr. Hook; but, without a moment's premedita<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_553" id="Page_553">[553]</a></span>tion,
he composed a verse upon every person in the room,
full of the most pointed wit, and with the truest rhymes,
unhesitatingly gathering into his subject, as he rapidly
proceeded, in addition to what had passed during the dinner,
every trivial incident of the moment. Every action was
turned to account; every circumstance, the look, the gesture,
or any other accidental effects, served as occasion for more
wit; and even the singer's ignorance of the names and condition
of many of the party seemed to give greater facility to
his brilliant hits than even acquaintance with them might have
furnished. Mr. Sheridan was astonished at his extraordinary
faculty, and declared that he could not have imagined such
power possible, had he not witnessed it. No description, he
said, could have convinced him of so peculiar an instance of
genius, and he protested that he should not have believed it
to be an unstudied effort, had he not seen proof that no
anticipation could have been formed of what might arise to
furnish matter and opportunities for the exercise of this rare
talent.&mdash;<cite>Memoirs of Charles Mathews, Comedian, by Mrs.
Mathews.</cite> Lond. 1838.</p>


<hr class="r15" />
<h3>HOOK'S "FIRST APPEARANCE."</h3>

<p>It was on the evening of Monday, January 30th, 1809, at
the "Grange Theatre," that Mr. Theodore Hook, then a
slim youth of fine figure, his head covered with black clustering
curls, made his "first appearance upon any stage,"
and in no instance do I remember a more decided case of
what is called stage-fright. He had been as bold and easy
during the rehearsals as if he had been a practised stager.
All the novices seemed fluttered but himself; but when he
entered at night as <em>Sir Callaghan O'Brallaghan</em>, the Irish
officer, in "Love à la Mode," he turned pale at the first sight
of the audience, and exhibited such palpable terror, that I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_554" id="Page_554">[554]</a></span>
almost supported him on my arm; his frame shook, his voice
failed him, and not a word of his first scene, nor a note
of the song he attempted at the piano-forte (which he had
sung so well in the morning), were audible to anybody but
myself.</p>

<p>It was curious to see a person of Mr. Hook's wondrous
nerve and self-possession suddenly subdued in such a way,
at a mere <em>make-believe</em> in a room, containing only friends&mdash;invulnerable
as he was to fear in all things else! He recovered,
however, before the piece concluded, and afterwards
acted <em>Vapour</em> in the farce of "My Grandmother," imitating
Mr. Farley excellently; and a character in an admirable
burlesque tragedy of his own writing, called "Ass-ass-ination,"
previously to which he hoaxed the audience with a
prologue, purposely unintelligible, but speciously delivered;
the first and last word of each line were only to be distinguished,
bearing in them all the <em>cant</em> and <em>rhymes</em> of such
addresses (some heard and others guessed at, as the speaker's
ingenuity served, for of course all was extempore). At the
close of this, great applause followed; and one elderly, important
gentleman was heard to whisper to another sitting
next him, "An excellent prologue, but abominably inarticulate!"</p>


<hr class="r15" />
<h3>HOOK AND DOWTON THE ACTOR.</h3>

<p>On one occasion poor Dowton was well-nigh frightened
from his propriety by the sudden appearance of his young
friend upon the stage, who, in appropriate costume, and with
an ultra-melodramatic strut, advanced in place of the regular
walking gentleman to offer him a letter. At another, during
the heat of a contested Westminster election, the whole
house was electrified by a solemn cry, proceeding apparently
from the fiend in the "Wood Demon," of "<span class="smcap">She-ri-dan for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_555" id="Page_555">[555]</a></span>
e-ver</span>!" and uttered in the deepest bass the speaking-trumpet
was capable of producing. This last piece of facetiousness
was rather seriously resented by Graham, one of the proprietors
of the Haymarket, who threatened its perpetrator
with perpetual suspension of his "privilege," and it required
all the interest of influential friends, backed by an ample
apology on the part of the culprit, who promised the most
strict observance of decorum for the future, to obtain a
reversal of the decree.</p>

<h3>LETTER FROM MAURITIUS.</h3>

<p>From "La Réduit, Mauritius," under date March 24, 1814,
Theodore Hook addressed the following humorous letter to
Charles Mathews:&mdash;</p>

<p>"<span class="smcap">My dear Mathews</span>,&mdash;Uninteresting as a letter must be
from an individual in a little African island, to you who are
at the very head-quarters and emporium of news and gaiety,
I shall risk annoying you and write, begging you to take
along with you that the stupidity of my epistle proceeds in
a great measure from the dearth of anything worth the name
of intelligence; for if I had anything to say, say it I would.</p>

<p>"I have received so much powerful assistance from your
public talents in my short dramatic career, and have enjoyed
so very many pleasant hours in your private society, that I
feel a great pride and gratification from this distance, where
flattery cannot be suspected, nor interested motives attach
themselves to praise, to express how warmly I feel and how
I appreciate both your exertions and your powers.</p>

<p>"You have read enough of this island, I daresay, not to
imagine that we live in huts on the sea-coast, or that, like
our gallant forefathers, we paint ourselves blue, and vote
pantaloons a prejudice. We are here surrounded by every
luxury which art can furnish, or dissipation suggest, in a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_556" id="Page_556">[556]</a></span>
climate the most delightful, in a country the most beautiful,
society the most gay, and pursuits the most fascinating.</p>

<p>"This is, by heavens, a Paradise, and not without angels.
The women are all handsome (not so handsome as English
women), all accomplished, their manners extremely good,
wit brilliant, and good-nature wonderful; this is picking out
the best! The "<span title="oi polloi">οι πολλοι</span>," as we say at Oxford, are, if I
may use the word, mindless&mdash;all blank&mdash;dance like devils,
and better than any people, for, like all fools, they are fond
of it, and naturally excel in proportion to their mental
debility; for the greater the fool the better the dancer.</p>

<p>"In short, the whole island is like fairy-land; every hour
seems happier than the last; the mildness of the air (the
sweetness of which, as it passes over spice-plantations and
orange-groves, is hardly conceivable), the clearness of the
atmosphere, the coolness of the evenings, and the loveliness
of the place itself, all combine to render it fascination. The
very thought of ever quitting it is like the apprehension of
the death or long parting with some near relation, and if it
were not that this feeling is counteracted by having some
friends at home, there is no inducement that would draw me
from such a perfect <em>Thule</em>.</p>

<p>"Make my kind remembrances to Mrs. Mathews, and tell
her that I hope to shake hands with her when we are both
twaddlers&mdash;that is, when she is as much of a twaddler as old
age can make her; and that when I return upon crutches
from foreign parts, I trust she will direct her <em>son</em> to pay me
every attention due to my infirmities.</p>

<p>"We have operas in the winter, which sets in about July;
our races, too, begin in July; we have an excellent beef-steak
club, and the best Freemasons' lodge in the world. We
have subscription concerts, and balls, and the parties in
private houses here are seldom less than from two to three
hundred. At the last ball given at the Government-house,
upwards of seven hundred and fifty ladies were present,
which, considering that the greater proportion of the female<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_557" id="Page_557">[557]</a></span>
population are <em>not admissible</em>, proves the number of inhabitants,
and the extent of the society.</p>

<p>"Pshaw! my letter is all about myself. Egotism from
beginning to end. Like Argus, there are at least an hundred
I's in it. Well, damn my I's, I will substitute the other
vowel, and assure you that, although at this distance, I am
sincerely and truly yours, and that you will find even in
Maurit<em>ius</em> U and I are not far asunder.</p>

<p>"I daresay some of my fat-headed friends in that little
island where the beef grows fancy that I am making a
fortune, considering that I am Treasurer! and Accountant-general!
Fresh butter, my dear fellow, is ten shillings per
pound; a coat costs thirty pounds English; a pair of gloves,
fifteen shillings; a bottle of claret, the best, ten pence; and
pine-apples a penny a piece. Thus, you see, while the
articles necessary to existence are exorbitant, luxuries are
dirt cheap, and a pretty life we do lead. Breakfast at eight,
always up by gun-fire, five o'clock; bathe and ride before
breakfast, after breakfast lounge about; at one have a regular
meal, yclep'd a tiffen&mdash;hot meats, vegetables, &amp;c.&mdash;and at
this we sit generally through the heat of the day, drinking
our wine, and munching our fruit; at five, or half-past, the
carriages come to the door, and we go either in them or in
palanquins to dress, which operation performed, we drive
out to the race-ground, and through the Champ de Mars, the
Hyde Park here, till half-past six; come into town, and at
seven dine, where we remain till ten or eleven, and then join
the French parties, as there is regularly a ball somewhere or
other every night: these things, blended with business, make
out the day and evening."</p>


<hr class="r15" />
<h3>EVADING A COACH FARE.</h3>

<p>Everybody has heard of the ingenious manner in which
Sheridan evaded payment of a considerable sum for coach-hire,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_558" id="Page_558">[558]</a></span>
by inveigling Richardson into the vehicle, getting up a
quarrel, no very difficult matter, then jumping out in
disgust, and leaving his irritable friend to recover his composure
and pay the fare. Hook, who, like all men of genius,
augmented the resources of his own wit by a judicious
borrowing from that of others, seems to have caught at this
idea when once, under similar circumstances, he found himself,
after a long and agreeable ride, without money to satisfy
the coachman&mdash;a friend happened to be passing&mdash;he was
hailed and taken up&mdash;but unfortunately proved to be, on
inquiry, as unprepared for any pecuniary transaction as
Theodore himself. A dull copyist would have broken down
at once; but with a promptitude and felicity of conception
that amply redeem the plagiarism, with whatever else he
may be left chargeable, Hook pulled the check-string and
bade the driver proceed as rapidly as possible to No. &mdash;,
&mdash;&mdash; Street, at the West End of the town, the residence of
a well-known "surgeon, &amp;c." Arrived, he ordered the
coachman to "knock and ring," as desired, with energy, and
on the door opening, told his friend to follow, and hastily
entered the house. "Mr. &mdash;&mdash;, is he at home? I must see
him immediately!" Mr. &mdash;&mdash; soon made his appearance,
when Hook, in an agitated and hurried tone, commenced:&mdash;</p>

<p>"My dear sir, I trust you are disengaged!" Mr. &mdash;&mdash;
bowed; "he was disengaged." "Thank Heaven!&mdash;pardon
my incoherence, sir&mdash;make allowance for the feelings of a
husband&mdash;<em>perhaps a father</em>&mdash;your attendance, sir, is instantly
required&mdash;<em>instantly</em>&mdash;by Mrs. &mdash;&mdash;, No. &mdash;, &amp;c., pray lose
not a moment; it is a <em>very</em> peculiar case, I assure you."</p>

<p>"I will start directly," replied the medical man; "I have
only to run upstairs, get my apparatus, and step into my
carriage."</p>

<p>"Ah! exactly," returned Hook; "but I am in agony till
I see you fairly off&mdash;don't think of ordering out your own
carriage&mdash;here's one at the door&mdash;jump into that."</p>

<p>Mr. &mdash;&mdash;, with a great mahogany case under his arm,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_559" id="Page_559">[559]</a></span>
made the jump, and quickly found himself at the house to
which he had been directed: it was the abode of a very
stiff-mannered, middle-aged maiden lady, not unknown to
Hook; one, moreover, to whom he owed a grudge, a kind of
debt he rarely failed to pay. The doctor was admitted, but
on explaining the object of his visit, soon found it convenient
to make a precipitate retreat from the claws of the infuriate
spinster into the arms of the hackney-coachman, who
deposited him in safety at his own door, which, however, he
declined quitting without the full amount of his fare.</p>


<hr class="r15" />
<h3>UNSUCCESSFUL HUNT FOR A DINNER.</h3>

<p>Theodore Hook thus writes to Charles Mathews from the
"Prince of Wales's Coffee House, 8 o'clock, September 21st,
1825:"&mdash;</p>

<p>"<span class="smcap">Dear Mat.</span>,&mdash;I never went sporting for a dinner that I
bagged my bird in my life. Broderip asked me to dine with
him to-day, and went out and forgot it; so, I said to myself,
says I, I want to ask Mat., or Mrs. Mat., two questions about
Charles's 'Trip to Rome.' So on, says I, I'll go to Millfield
Lane. I did. On my way I forgot why Broderip forgot <em>his</em>
engagement;&mdash;natural enough&mdash;modern Aristophanes&mdash;beautiful
view&mdash;charming grounds&mdash;pleasant company,&mdash;poor me,
of course, rejected. Well, up I <em>goes</em>. Man with powder and
an apron opens gate&mdash;expecting company&mdash;doesn't know
whether Mr. Mathews is at home or no&mdash;goes to see&mdash;good
butler, but cannot lie steadily; so out comes a woman. Satire
on the sex to think they have more composure than man in a
quandary.&mdash;Master not at home.&mdash;Novelty, says I, Mathews
<em>at Home</em>, anybody can see: but, to see Mat. not at home, is
not to be bought. 'Thank you, ma'am,' says I; and downhill
I tumbled. At its foot, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">ex pede</i>, I discovered (not <em>Herculem</em>)
but the reason why you chose to deny yourself. Why<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_560" id="Page_560">[560]</a></span>
didn't you come out and speak? I most ardently eschew
your mutton, beef, veal, and ham. I only wanted three words
of you.&mdash;That's your affair. Now, thinks I, Broderip has
cut me, and Mathews has denied himself, I'll go and dine
with Nash. Nash dined <em>out</em>, waiting for the great gentleman
from <em>Berkshire</em>. I called upon Lyon (<em>James</em>), but, like his
namesake, he had <em>abdicated</em>. Met Sir Hudson Lowe&mdash;did
not ask me; called at Elliott's&mdash;<em>they</em> dined <em>out</em>; so I damned
my fate, and ordered dinner at seven here, and here I am;
and so I will punish your long legs with a threepenny. Write
to me, or ask Mrs. Mat. to write, and tell me of the name of
the <em>tune</em> of 'The Trip to Rome,' which it is essential to
know; and, if she can furnish me with the <em>second</em> verse <em>complete</em>,
I should be obliged, for Charles has sent only half the
stanza.</p>

<p>"Despatch in all this is important: it is a very, <em>very</em> clever
production, and Charles <em>shall</em> be, what I am sure he <em>will</em>, an
honour and a blessing to you both; and so I, in the dumps
as I am, pray he may."</p>

<h3>HOOK AT LORD MELVILLE'S TRIAL.</h3>

<p>On the occasion of Lord Melville's trial, Theodore Hook
was present with a friend.</p>

<p>They went early, and were engaged in conversation when
the Peers began to enter. At this moment a country-looking
lady, whom he afterwards found to be a resident at Rye, in
Sussex, touched his arm, and said: "I beg your pardon, sir,
but pray who are those gentlemen in red now coming in?"
"Those, ma'am," returned Theodore, "are the Barons of
England; in these cases the junior peers always come first."
"Thank you, sir, much obliged to you. Louisa, my dear
(turning to a girl about fourteen), tell Jane (about ten), those
are the Barons of England; and the juniors (that's the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_561" id="Page_561">[561]</a></span>
youngest, you know,) always goes first. Tell her to be sure
and remember that when we get home." "Dear me, ma!"
said Louisa, "can that gentleman be one of the <em>youngest</em>? I
am sure he looks very old." Human nature, added Hook,
could not stand this; any one, though with no more
mischief in him than a dove, must have been excited to a
hoax. "And pray, sir," continued the lady, "what gentlemen
are those?" pointing to the Bishops, who came next in
order, in the dress which they wear on state occasions, viz.,
the scarlet and lawn sleeves over their doctors' robes.
"Gentlemen, ma'am!" said Hook, "those are not gentlemen;
those are <em>ladies</em>, elderly ladies&mdash;the Dowager Peeresses
in their own right." The fair inquirer fixed a penetrating
glance upon his countenance, saying, as plainly as an eye can
say, "Are you quizzing me or no?" Not a muscle moved;
till at last, tolerably satisfied with her scrutiny, she turned
round and whispered, "Louisa, dear, the gentleman <em>says</em> that
these are elderly ladies, and Dowager Peeresses in their own
right; tell Jane not to forget <em>that</em>!" All went on smoothly
till the Speaker of the House of Commons attracted her attention
by the rich embroidery of his robes. "Pray, sir," said
she, "and who is that fine-looking person opposite?" "That,
madam," was the answer, "is Cardinal Wolsey!" "No,
sir!" cried the lady, drawing herself up, and casting at her
informant a look of angry disdain, "we knows a little better
than that; Cardinal Wolsey has been dead many a good
year!" "No such thing, my dear madam, I assure you,"
replied Hook, with a gravity that must have been almost preternatural;
"it has been, I know, so reported in the country,
but without the least foundation; in fact, those rascally
newspapers will say anything." The good old gentlewoman
appeared thunderstruck, opened her eyes to their full extent,
and gasped like a dying carp; <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">vox faucibus hæsit</i>, seizing a
daughter with each hand, she hurried without a word from
the spot.&mdash;<cite>Ingoldsby Legends</cite>, 3rd series, p. 69.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_562" id="Page_562">[562]</a></span></p>


<h3>THE THIRTY-NINE ARTICLES.</h3>

<p>Hook had been entered at St. Mary's Hall: his friends
would have preferred a residence at Exeter College, but
to this, as entailing a somewhat more strict observance
of discipline than was compatible with his habits, he himself
positively objected. A compromise was effected, and he
was placed under the charge of his brother, and presented
by him to the Vice-Chancellor, Dr. Parsons, Head of Balliol,
and afterwards Bishop of Peterborough, for matriculation.
The ceremony was well-nigh stopped <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">in limine</i>, in consequence
of an ill-timed piece of facetiousness on the part of
the candidate. On being asked if he was prepared to subscribe
to the Thirty-nine Articles:</p>

<p>"Oh, certainly, sir," replied Theodore; "<em>forty, if you
please</em>."<a name="FNanchor_77" id="FNanchor_77"></a><a href="#Footnote_77" class="fnanchor">[77]</a></p>

<p>The horror of the Vice-Chancellor may be imagined. The
young gentleman was desired to withdraw; and it required
all the interest of his brother, who fortunately happened to
be a personal friend of Dr. Parsons, to induce the latter to
overlook the offence. The joke, such as it is, was probably
picked out of one of Foote's farces, who makes Mrs. Simony,
if we mistake not, say, when speaking of her husband the
Doctor (intended for the unfortunate Dr. Dodd), "He believes
in all the Thirty-nine Articles; ay, and so he would if there
were forty of them."&mdash;<cite>Barham.</cite></p>


<hr class="r15" />
<h3>"CHAFFING" A PROCTOR.</h3>

<p>On the evening of Hook's arrival at the University, he
contrived to give his brother the slip, and joined a party<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_563" id="Page_563">[563]</a></span>
of old schoolfellows in a carouse at one of the taverns.
Sundry bowls of "Bishop," and of a popular compound
yclept "Egg-flip"&mdash;the Cambridge men call it "Silky,"
to the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">nondum graduati</i> of Oxford it is known by a <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">nomen
accidentale</i> which we have forgotten,&mdash;having been discussed;
songs, amatory and Bacchanalian, having been sung with
full choruses; and altogether the jocularity having begun to
pass "the limit of becoming mirth," the Proctor made his
appearance; and, advancing to the table at which the
"Freshman"&mdash;fresh in every sense of the word&mdash;was presiding,
put the usual question,&mdash;</p>

<p>"Pray, sir, are you a member of this University?"</p>

<p>"No, sir," replied Hook, rising and bowing respectfully.
"Pray, sir, are you?"</p>

<p>A little disconcerted at the extreme gravity of the other,
the Proctor held out his ample sleeve&mdash;"You see this, sir?"</p>

<p>"Ah," returned Hook, having examined the fabric with
great earnestness for a few seconds, "yes; I perceive&mdash;Manchester
velvet&mdash;and may I take the liberty, sir, of
inquiring how much you might have paid per yard for the
article?"</p>

<p>The quiet imperturbability of manner with which this was
uttered was more than the Rev. gentleman could stand;
and, muttering something about "supposing it was a
mistake," he effected a retreat, amid shouts of laughter from
Hook's companions, in which the other occupants of the
coffee-room, the waiters, and even his own "bull-dogs"
were constrained to join.&mdash;<cite>Barham.</cite></p>

<h3>SUMMARY PROCEEDINGS OF WINTER.</h3>

<p>Of Hook's improvisations, while at the Mauritius, a stanza
of one, in which the names of the company seem to have
furnished, each, the subject of an epigram, is extant; it runs
as follows:&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_564" id="Page_564">[564]</a></span></p>

</div></div></div>


<hr class="r15" />
<h3>"SOMETHING WRONG IN THE CHEST."</h3>

<p>At St. Helena, Hook encountered the late Lord Charles
Somerset, on his way to assume the governorship of the
Cape. Lord Charles, who had met him in London occasionally,
and knew nothing of his arrest, said, "I hope you
are not going home for your health, Mr. Hook." "Why,"
said Theodore, "I am sorry to say, they think there is
something wrong in the <em>chest</em>."&mdash;<cite>Quarterly Review</cite>, vol.
lxxiii., p. 73.</p>


<hr class="r15" />
<h3>WARREN'S BLACKING.</h3>

<p>In the art of punning, whatever be its merits or de-merits,
Hook had few rivals, and but one superior, if indeed one&mdash;we
mean Mr. Thomas Hood. Among the innumerable
"Theodores" on record, it will be difficult, of course, to
pick out the best; but what he himself considered to be
such, was addressed to the late unfortunate Mr. F&mdash;&mdash;, an
artist, who subsequently committed suicide at the "Salopian"
coffee-house for love, as it is said, of a popular actress. They
were walking in the neighbourhood of Kensington, when the
latter pointing out on a dead wall an incomplete or half-effaced
inscription, running "Warren's B&mdash;&mdash;," was puzzled
at the moment for the want of the context.</p>

<p>"'Tis <em>lacking</em> that should follow," observed Hook, in
explanation. Nearly as good was his remark on the Duke
of Darmstadt's brass band.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_565" id="Page_565">[565]</a></span></p>

<p>"They well-nigh stun one," said he, in reference to a
morning concert, "with those terrible wind instruments,
which roar away in defiance of all rule, except that which
Hoyle addresses to young whist-players when in doubt&mdash;<em>trump
it!</em>"</p>

<h3>THE WINE-CELLAR AND THE BOOK-SELLER.</h3>

<p>Theodore Hook's saying to some man with whom a
bibliopolist dined the other day, and got extremely drunk,
"Why, you appear to me to have emptied your <em>wine</em>-cellar
into your <em>book</em>-seller."&mdash;<cite>Moore's Diary</cite>, Feb., 1836.</p>


<hr class="r15" />
<h3>SIR ROBERT PEEL'S ANECDOTES OF THEODORE
HOOK.</h3>

<p>The late Sir Robert Peel was strongly impressed with Hook's
conversational powers and the genuine readiness of his wit;
in illustration of this, he used to relate, among others, the
following anecdote:&mdash;One morning, at Drayton Manor, where
Hook was staying as a guest, some one after breakfast happened
to read out from the newspaper a paragraph, in which
a well-known coroner was charged with having had a corpse
unnecessarily disinterred. The ladies were very severe in
condemnation of such unfeeling conduct; a gallant captain,
however, who was present, took up the cudgels in behalf of
the accused, maintaining that he was a very kind-hearted
man, and incapable of doing anything without strong reasons,
calculated to annoy the friends of the deceased. The contest
waxed warm: "Come," said Captain &mdash;&mdash;, at length, turning
to Hook, who was poring over the <cite>Times</cite> in a corner of
the room, and who had taken no part in the discussion,
"you know W&mdash;&mdash;, what do you think of him? Is he not
a good-tempered, good-natured fellow?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_566" id="Page_566">[566]</a></span></p>

<p>"Indeed he is," replied Hook, laying aside his paper,
"I should say he was just the very man to <em>give a body a lift</em>."</p>

<p>On the same authority, we may repeat a pun made at the
expense of the Duke of Rutland. There was a grand entertainment
at Belvoir Castle, on the occasion of the coming of
age of the Marquis of Granby; the company were going out
to see the fireworks, when Hook came, in great tribulation,
to the Duke, who was standing near Sir Robert, and said,
"Now isn't this provoking! I've lost my hat&mdash;what can I
do?" "Why the deuce," returned his grace, "did you part
with your hat?&mdash;I never do!" "Yes," rejoined Theodore,
"but you have especially good reasons for sticking to your
<em>Beaver</em>."<a name="FNanchor_78" id="FNanchor_78"></a><a href="#Footnote_78" class="fnanchor">[78]</a></p>


<hr class="r15" />
<h3>A RECEIPT AGAINST NIGHT AIR.</h3>

<p>"Theodore Hook," writes a friend, "had a receipt of his
own to prevent invalids from being exposed to the night air.
I remember his once taking me home from a party in his
cab, between four and five o'clock on a brilliant morning in
July. I made some remark, soon after we had passed Hyde
Park Corner, about the reviving quality of the air after the
heated rooms we had been in. 'Ah,' said Hook, 'you may
depend on it, my dear fellow, that there is nothing more
injurious to health than the night air. I was very ill some
months ago, and my doctor gave me particular orders not to
expose myself to it.' 'I hope,' said I, 'you attended to
them?' 'O yes!' said he, 'strictly; I came up every day
to Crockford's or some other place to dinner, and I made it a
rule on no account to go home again till about this hour in
the morning.'"</p>


<hr class="r15" />
<h3 class="lsp2">PUNTING.</h3>

<p>"In the course of our fishing, we had been punted down
the river opposite to Lord &mdash;&mdash;'s house, and while seated in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_567" id="Page_567">[567]</a></span>
front of it, he remarked that he used to be on very friendly
terms with the noble owner; but that a coolness had lately
sprung up between them, in consequence of his lordship
having taken umbrage at the epitaph (pointed with a clever
but objectionable pun) he had composed for his late brother,
so unhappily notorious for the charges brought against him
of false play at whist. On seeing the present Peer out on the
river fishing, Hook had received from him, instead of his
usual courteous greeting, a very stiff, ceremonious bow; but,
determined not to notice it, he only replied:&mdash;</p>

<p>"'What, my lord, following the family occupation, eh?&mdash;<em>punting</em>,
I see&mdash;punting!'"</p>

<p>An impromptu of Hook's on the same subject, ran the
round of the club-houses. It will be remembered that the
nobleman alluded to brought an action for defamation against
certain of his accusers, which, however, he thought proper to
abandon at the last moment.</p>

<h3>"LIST" SHOES.</h3>

<p>The Duke of B&mdash;&mdash;, who was to have been one of the
knights at the Eglinton Tournament, was lamenting that he
was obliged to excuse himself, on the ground of an attack of
the gout.</p>

<p>"How," said he, "could I ever get my poor puffed legs
into those abominable iron boots?"</p>

<p>"It will be quite as appropriate," replied Hook, "if your
Grace goes in your <em>list</em> shoes."</p>

<h3>"THE ABATTOIR."</h3>

<p>When Messrs. Abbott and Egerton, in 1836, took the old
Coburg Theatre (the Victoria), for the purpose of bringing
forward the legitimate drama, the former gentleman asked
Hook if he could suggest a new name, the old being too
much identified with blue fire and broad swords to suit the
proposed change of performance. "Why," said Theodore,
"as, of course, you will butcher everything you attempt,
suppose you call it the <em>Abattoir</em>."</p>

<h3>PUTNEY BRIDGE.</h3>

<p>Hook's residence at Putney afforded occasion for the
delivery of one of the best of his best <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">bon-mots</i>. A friend,
viewing Putney bridge from the little terrace that overhung
the Thames, observed that he had been informed that it was
a very good investment, and, turning to his host, inquired
"if such was the case&mdash;if the bridge really answered?"</p>

<p>"I don't know," said Theodore, "but you have only to
cross it, and you are sure to be <em>tolled</em>."</p>

<h3>"MR. THOMPSON IS TIRED."</h3>

<p>Some years ago an ingenious representation of the destruction
of a Swiss village by an avalanche was exhibited at the
Diorama in the Regent's Park, the effect of which was
greatly increased by a clever vocal imitation of the dreary
winter wind whistling through the mountains; but this
sound ceasing whilst the exigencies of the scene still
demanded its continuance, Theodore Hook, who was present,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_569" id="Page_569">[569]</a></span>
exclaimed, "<em>Bless me, Mr. Thompson is tired</em>," which set
the spectators laughing, nor could they at all resume the
awe-struck gravity with which they had previously
witnessed the tragic picture.&mdash;<cite>Edinburgh Review</cite>, July,
1859.</p>


<hr class="r15" />
<h3>THE ORIGINAL "PAUL PRY."</h3>

<p>Tom Hill, the real original "Paul Pry," was reported to
be of great age; and Theodore Hook circulated the apology
that his baptismal register could not be found, because it was
burnt in the Tower of London.&mdash;<cite>Henry Crabb Robinson's
Diary.</cite></p>

<p>Mr. Hill died aged not more than eighty-three&mdash;though
Hook and all his friends always affected to consider him
as quite a Methuselah. James Smith once said that it was
impossible to discover his age, for the parish register had
been burnt in the fire of London; but Hook capped this:
"Pooh pooh! he's one of the Little Hills that are spoken of
as skipping in the Psalms." As a mere octogenarian he was
wonderful enough. No human being would, from his
appearance, gait, or habits, have guessed him to be sixty.
Till within three months of his death, he rose at five usually,
and brought the materials of his breakfast home with him to
the Adelphi from a walk to Billingsgate; and at dinner he
would eat and drink like an adjutant of five-and-twenty. One
secret was that a "banyan day" uniformly followed a
festivity. He then nursed himself most carefully on tea and
dry toast, tasted neither meat nor wine, and went to bed
by eight o'clock. But perhaps the grand secret was, the easy,
imperturbable serenity of his temper. He had been kind and
generous in the day of his wealth, and, though his evening
was comparatively poor, his cheerful heart kept its even
beat.</p>

<h3>HOOK AND TOM HILL.</h3>

<p>Notwithstanding the real affection he felt for him, Hook
was sometimes led, as is the case with spoiled children,
whether of larger or lesser growth, to trespass overmuch upon
the good nature of his friend&mdash;almost worshipper&mdash;and to
allow himself liberties which no degree of intimacy could
justify. An instance of the kind occurred at Sydenham, when
Hook, resenting the introduction of a comparative stranger to
their saturnalia, chose to assume all sorts of extraordinary
and offensive airs, to the great discomfiture of his host, who,
with the warmest desire to "see everybody comfortable,"
had not always, perhaps, tact commensurate with his benevolence.
Having completely mystified the unwelcome
guest during the hour or two before dinner, when that meal
was served Mr. Hook was not to be found; search was made
throughout the house, but in vain. The garden was scoured
and a peep taken into the pond, but no Hook! The party
at length sat down, and a servant soon after informed them
that he had discovered the lost one&mdash;in bed! Hook now
thought fit to make his appearance, which he did in strange
guise, with his long black hair plastered over his face, and
his whole head and shoulders dripping with water. "Feeling
a little fatigued," he said, "he had retired to rest; and, by
way of thoroughly arousing himself, had just taken a plunge
in the water-butt;" at the same moment, and before he had
time to partake of any of the good things before him, Mr.
Hook's carriage was announced; and merely observing that
he had recollected an engagement to dine that day in town
he bowed and quitted the company.</p>


<hr class="r15" />
<h3>HOOK'S POLITENESS.</h3>

<p>Hook was once observed, during dinner, nodding like a
Chinese mandarin in a tea-shop. On being asked the reason,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_571" id="Page_571">[571]</a></span>
he replied, "Why, when no one else asks me to take champagne,
I take sherry with the épergne and bow to the flowers."&mdash;<cite>Mark
Lemon's Jest Book.</cite></p>


<hr class="r15" />
<h3>A BISCUIT AND A GLASS OF SHERRY.</h3>

<p>Mr. Price was an American by birth, and a proficient, it
is said, in the national accomplishment&mdash;duelling; in this
country he was more favourably known as a <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">bon vivant</i> of
taste, and a giver of bachelor dinners of a high order; he
was, moreover, the first promulgator of one of those Transatlantic
beverages, which are justly the admiration of the
curious. It is a species of punch, in which gin, maraschino,
and iced soda-water are blended in a certain occult and
scientific way, and is esteemed of sovereign worth in very
hot weather, or in cases where an obstinate and unaccountable
thirst has somehow survived the repeated efforts made
to quench it the preceding day.</p>

<p>Hook, one afternoon succeeding a banquet at the Freemasons'
Tavern, where the port had been particularly fiery,
or the salmon had disagreed with him, happened to drop in
at "the Club," and found the mighty master with an
amphora of his potent elixir before him: the former was
with some difficulty&mdash;probably no great deal&mdash;induced to
give an opinion as to its merits; but it was a matter not
to be decided lightly, and some half-dozen pints of the
beguiling compound were discussed ere the authoritative
"<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">imbibatur</i>" went forth. In the evening, at Lord Canterbury's,
Hook was observed to eat even less than usual, and,
on being asked whether he was unwell, replied&mdash;</p>

<p>"Oh no, not exactly; but my stomach won't bear trifling
with, and I was foolish enough to take a biscuit and a glass
of sherry by way of luncheon."</p>


<hr class="r15" />
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_572" id="Page_572">[572]</a></span></p>

<h3>MUCH ALIKE.</h3>

<p>Two silly brothers, twins, were very much about town in
Hook's time; and they took every pains, by dressing alike,
to deceive their friends as to their identity. Tom Hill was
expatiating upon these modern Dromios, at which Hook grew
impatient. "Well," said Hill, "you will admit that they
resemble each other wonderfully: they are as like as two
peas." "They are," retorted Hook, "and quite as green!"</p>


<hr class="r15" />
<h3>PRIVATE MEDICAL PRACTICE.</h3>

<p>Hook, in "Cousin William," calls the aunt and uncle bold
<em>Buchan</em>-eers, from their fondness for rash domestic medical
practice, and doctoring themselves from Buchan. In describing
the original of this aunt, at the Garrick, one morning,
he declared that the old lady was so delighted with everything
pertaining to physic, that she drank wine every six hours out
of <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">dose-glasses</i>, and filled her gold-fish globes with leeches, the
evolutions of which she watched by the hour.</p>


<hr class="r15" />
<h3>HOOK'S STREET FUN.</h3>

<p>Hook's street fun was irrepressible. We read of his
walking up to a pompous person in the <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">trottoir</i> in the Strand,
and saying to him, "I beg your pardon, sir, but may I ask,
<em>Are you anybody particular?</em>?"&mdash;but he did not wait for the
answer of the magnifico.</p>


<hr class="r15" />
<h3>A MISNOMER.</h3>

<p>Hook said the title of Bentley's new magazine was ominous:
"Miss-sell-any;" but his prophecy was not borne out
by the event.</p>


<hr class="r15" />
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_573" id="Page_573">[573]</a></span></p>

<h3>"CONTINGENCIES."</h3>

<p>Theodore Hook used to describe contingencies as "things
that never happen."&mdash;<cite>Life of Ingoldsby.</cite></p>


<hr class="r15" />
<h3>"THE WIDOW'S MITE."</h3>

<p>After his marriage, Lord John Russell was christened by
Hook "the Widow's Mite."&mdash;<cite>Ingoldsby.</cite></p>


<hr class="r15" />
<h3>HOOK'S EXTEMPORE VERSES.</h3>

<p>Theodore Hook, in his twentieth year, gave evidence of
the possession of a talent, compared with which mimicry in
its perfection, available enough as an auxiliary, sinks into
insignificance&mdash;that of the improvisatore. Men of mark are
found bearing testimony to the inspirations of his genius;
marvellous at the early age referred to, but far surpassed by
his later performances. Coleridge, for example, at the termination
of a somewhat prolonged revel held at the cottage
of Mr. Mansel Reynolds, is said to have proclaimed, in his
declamatory manner, that he had never met a man who could
bring such various and amazing resources of mind to bear on
the mere whim or folly of the moment; while the poet Campbell
spoke of him as "a wonderful creature," who sang
extempore songs, "not to my admiration, but to my astonishment."
Those who have been in the habit of attending
public meetings, or have listened to the harangues, so glibly
"done into English" by next morning, of the orators of St.
Stephen's, cannot fail to have remarked how rarely even
respectable prose is delivered where opportunity for preparation
has been wanting. But in the art, if art it may be called,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_574" id="Page_574">[574]</a></span>
of pouring forth extemporaneous poetry, music and words,
rhyme and reason, all impromptu, Hook stood alone&mdash;rival
he had none; of course he had his imitators:</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<p class="verse">"The charming extempore verses of Twiss's,"</p>
</div></div></div>

<p>for example, will not readily be forgotten; another gentleman,
also, found reason to remember his attempt at rivalry. Ambitious
of distinction, he took an opportunity of striking off
into verse immediately after one of Hook's happiest efforts.
Theodore's bright eye flashed, and fixed on the intruder, who
soon began to flounder in the meshes of his stanza, when
he was put out of his misery at once by the following couplet
from the master, given, however, with a good-humoured smile
that robbed it of all offence:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<p class="verseq">"I see, sir, I see, sir, what 'tis that you're hatching;</p>
<p class="verse">But mocking, you see, sir, is not <em>always</em> catching."</p>
</div></div></div>

<p>There can be no doubt as to the perfect genuineness of
these marvellous efforts of the human intellect; the word was
given and the "numbers came," gushing fresh and sparkling
from the fount. His companions at the table, and the observations
that had fallen from them, afforded not unfrequently
matter for his good-natured muse. But as often a subject
impossible in any way to have been anticipated, was proposed
by one of the company, generally the most incredulous,
and with scarce a moment's consideration, he would place
himself at the piano-forte, run over the keys, and break forth
into a medley of merriment, of which, unhappily, no idea can
be conveyed, for the benefit and conversion of the sceptic.</p>

<p>The names of those present were frequently woven into
the rhyme, or made to supply points to the verse. He is said
once to have encountered a pair of most unmanageable patronymics,
those of Sir Moses Ximenes, and Mr. Rosenagen, a
young Dane; the line antiphonetic to the former has escaped
us; the latter, reserved till near the conclusion, was thus
played upon:&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_575" id="Page_575">[575]</a></span></p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry">

<p class="verse">Alas! I fear she is done;</p>
<p class="verse">But no! like a fiddler that's tired,</p>

<h3>HOOK EXTEMPORISES A MELODRAMA.</h3>

<p>Hook placed himself at the piano-forte, and gave a most
extraordinary display of his powers, both as a musician and
an improvisatore. His assumed object was to give a specimen
of the burlettas formerly produced at Sadler's Wells, and
he went through the whole of one which he composed upon
the spot. He commenced with the tuning of the instruments,
the prompter's bell, the rapping of the fiddlestick by the
leader of the band, and the overture, till, the curtain being
supposed to rise, he proceeded to describe&mdash;</p>

<p>The first scene.&mdash;A country village&mdash;cottage, (<span class="fs70">O. P.</span>)&mdash;church
(<span class="fs70">P. S.</span>) Large tree near wing. Bridge over a river
occupying the centre of the background. Music.&mdash;Little
men in red coats seen riding over bridge. Enter&mdash;Gaffer
from cottage, to the symphony usually played on introducing
old folks on such occasions. Gaffer, in recitative, intimates
that he is aware that the purpose of the Squire in thus
early&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<p class="verse8">"A crossing over the water,</p>

a determination to balk his intentions:&mdash;</p>

<p class="verse">And a father has feelings, though never so poor."</p>
</div></div></div>

<p class="noindent">Enter Squire with his train.&mdash;Grand chorus of huntsmen&mdash;"Merry-toned
horn, Blithe is the morn," "Hark forward,
away, Glorious Day," "Bright Phœbus," "Aurora," etc.,
etc.</p>

<p>The Squire dismisses all save his confidant, to whom, in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_576" id="Page_576">[576]</a></span>
recitative, he avows his design of carrying off the old man's
daughter, then sings under her window. The casement up
one pair of stairs opens. Susan appears at it and sings&mdash;asking
whether the voice which has been serenading her is
that of her "true blue William, who, on the seas,&mdash;is blown
about by every breeze." The Squire, hiding behind the tree,
she descends to satisfy herself; is accosted by him, and refuses
his offer; he attempts force. The old man interferes,
lectures the Squire, locks up his daughter, and exit (<span class="fs70">P. S.</span>).
Squire sings a song expressive of rage, and his determination
to obtain the girl, and exit (<span class="fs70">P. S.</span>).</p>

<p>Whistle&mdash;Scene changes with a slap.&mdash;Public-house door;
sailors carousing, with long pig-tails, checked shirts, glazed
hats, and blue trousers. Chorus&mdash;"Jolly tars, Plough the
main,&mdash;Kiss the girls, Sea again." William, in recitative,
states that he has been "With brave Rodney," and has got
"Gold galore;" tells his messmates he has heard a landlubber
means to run away with his sweetheart, and asks their
assistance. They promise it.</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry">

<h3>"ASS-ASS-INATION."</h3>

<p>"Ass-ass-ination," a sort of burlesque on Hamlet, was
another of Hook's extravaganzas, broad enough "for the
meanest capacity," but amusing withal, abounding in point
and pun, as well as local hits, and quite worthy the attention
of any country manager, whether amateur or professional,
who may happen to be at a loss for Christmas novelties.
Take, by way of sample, the opening scene:&mdash;</p>

<p class="center"><em>Enter</em> Princess, <em>with a light</em>.</p>

<p><em>Princess.</em> 'Tis midnight! Suspicion's gone to sleep.
Credulity has warmed the bed, and Dulness tucked him up.
My father is not dead; I've hoaxed the public; I've shut
my regal daddy in the coal-hole, and now am Regent. The

<p><em>Mum.</em> From Finland!&mdash;pshaw! A king of dolphins and
Prince of Whales.</p>


<hr class="r15" />
<h3>"WEATHER OR NO."</h3>

<p>The last time that Theodore Hook dined at Amen Corner,
he was unusually late, and dinner was served before he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_579" id="Page_579">[579]</a></span>
made his appearance. Mr. Barham apologized for having
sat down without him, observing that he had quite given him
up, and had supposed "that the weather had deterred him."</p>

<p>"Oh!" replied Hook, "I had determined to come,
<em>weather</em> or no."&mdash;<cite>Life of Rev. R. H. Barham.</cite></p>


<hr class="r15" />
<h3>DIAMOND CUT DIAMOND.</h3>

<p>Hook told a story of a gentleman driving his Irish servant
in his cab, and saying to him, half jocularly, half in anger:</p>

<p>"If the gallows had its due, you rascal, where would you
be now?"</p>

<p>"Faith, then, your honour, it's riding in this cab I'd be,
all alone by myself may be!"</p>


<hr class="r15" />
<h3>TOM MOORE.&mdash;LOSING A HAT.</h3>

<p>Words cannot do justice to Theodore Hook's talent for
improvisation: it was perfectly wonderful. He was one day
sitting at the pianoforte, singing an extempore song as
fluently as if he had had the words and music before him,
when Moore happened to look into the room, and Hook
instantly introduced a long parenthesis,</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<p class="verseq">"And here's Mr. Moore,</p>
<p class="verse">Peeping in at the door," &amp;c.</p>
</div></div></div>

<p class="noindent">The last time I saw Hook was in the lobby of Lord
Canterbury's house after a large evening party there. He
was walking up and down, singing with great gravity, to the
astonishment of the footmen, "Shepherds, I have lost my
hat."&mdash;<cite>Rogers's Table Talk.</cite></p>


<hr class="r15" />
<h3>"GOOD NIGHT."</h3>

<p>Wherever Hook came he was a welcome guest; and his
arrival was the signal for hilarity and festivity. The dining-room
and the drawing-room were alike his theatres; the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_580" id="Page_580">[580]</a></span>
former was enlivened by the jest and song, the latter by
music and improvisation, of which he was master beyond
any man that perhaps England ever beheld. Our untractable
language was to him as easy as the fascile Italian,
and whether seated at the genial board, with a few choice
companions, or at the pianoforte, surrounded by admiring
beauty, his performances in this way were the delight and
admiration of all who heard them. They were, indeed,
very extraordinary. Some of them might have been printed
as finished ballads; and others, though not so perfect in
parts as metrical compositions, were so studded with bright
conceits, and often so touched with exquisite sentiment and
pathos, that their effect upon the audience was evinced by
shouts of laughter, or starting tears.</p>

<p>We remember one beautiful example of the latter. At
a party at Prior's Bank, Fulham, it was morning before
the guests departed, yet Hook remained to the last, and a
light of other days brightened his features as he again
opened the piano and began a recitative. Another extempore
song had been begged by a bevy of lovely dames, and
Hook hastened to comply with their request&mdash;the subject
this time being "Good Night." The singer had proceeded
through a few verses, and at length uttered a happy thought,
which excited a joyous laugh in a fair young boy standing
by his side. At this moment one of the servants suddenly
opened the drawing-room shutters, and a flood of light fell
upon the lad's head. The effect was very touching, but it
became a thousand times more so as Hook, availing himself
of the incident, placed his hand upon the youth's brow, and
in tremulous tones uttered a verse of which only the concluding
lines are remembered:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<p class="verseq">"For <em>you</em> is the dawn of the morning,</p>
<p class="verse">For <em>me</em> is the solemn good night."</p>
</div></div></div>

<p>He rose from the piano, burst into tears, and left the room.
Few of those who were present saw him afterwards.</p>

novels, "Pen Owen," and "Percy Mallory," which at the time were
commonly ascribed to Theodore, and which would hardly have done him
any discredit. They have been republished, as they well deserved to
be, in a cheap form. The picture of the Cato-street Conspiracy, in one
of them, is most striking.</p></div>

making sport to the Philistines out of his own calamity and disgrace;
but it is stranger still that he is said to have in fact adopted some hints
from a version of Allan's suicide, which found favour with the lowest
only of his political haters, and the circulation of which in a street
broadside had seemed to give him very serious annoyance. We quote
some verses of this doggrel, just to show that Hook had to take as well
as give:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry">

<p class="verse">So let's e'en hop the twig in the old Roman way!'</p>
</div>

<div class="stanza">
<p class="verse">'O massa!' says Allan, 'whatever you do,</p>

<p class="verse">Make ready, present, and when mine goes off&mdash;fire!'</p>
</div>

<div class="stanza">
<p class="verse">Humble Allan then manfully emptied his glass,</p>
<p class="verse">And with pistol on cock to the bed-room did pass;</p>
<p class="verse">In a moment he heard massa's <em>bang</em>, and the nigger</p>

Board of Control, March 16, 1822, took occasion to observe: "It happened
that he had himself been Secretary, once upon a time, to this
Board; during the thirteen months he was there, there was no board at
all that he ever saw. His right honourable friend (Mr. Tierney) sat in
one room, himself in another, and the gentlemen commissioners in a
third. * * * He must also state, that during all the time he was
there, there was not business enough for the situation." An admission
which elicited the following sarcasm from Mr. Canning. "It seemed,"
said the latter, "a little extraordinary, that the idle secretary should be
the person who called for such an inquiry. This was reform with a
vengeance. This was no unfaithful picture of those principles on which
reform was usually clamoured for. If they traced the principles of
those who raised that clamour to their source, it would be found that
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">habites rem confitentem</i>, and that, nine times out of ten, the evil existed
only when the clamour was raised. It was beyond his hopes that any
Hon. Gent. should be so blinded by his fancies as to come forward with
such a notice under such circumstances, crying aloud, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">'Me, me, adsum
qui (non) feci!</i>' I am the man who did nothing; and I now call upon
you to inquire why those men associated with me, and who were diligent,
failed to follow my example."&mdash;<cite>Barham.</cite></p></div>

respectfully to declare, that she perseveres in the resolution of declining
any arrangement while her name continues to be excluded from the

talked of; but her Majesty was eventually induced to reconsider her
determination, and accept the £50,000 per annum.&mdash;<cite>Barham.</cite></p></div>

hardly necessary to remind our readers in general, though Mr. Scarlett
was not aware of the circumstance, that Bishop Lowth, who wrote the

with as much familiarity as if she had been Mrs. Whittington; but the
Black Prince had just at the time set such an example to the people, in
his behaviour to the French king; to whom he declared, "that being a
subject, he was too well acquainted with the distance between his own
rank, and that of Majesty, to assume such a freedom as to sit in its
presence."&mdash;(Hume, vol. iii. p. 88.) That the tone of good-breeding
pervaded all classes, and reached even Matthew, who by the excessive

<p class="noindent pad2"><span class="smcap">Scott.</span> With numerous fine Illustrations.</p>

<p><i>"The Lady of the Lake" has been chosen as a subject for illustration, not only for
its picturesque features, which invite in an unusual degree the sympathetic treatment
of the artist, but also for the romantic personal interest which the story inspires, and
which gives it a close hold on the affections of all readers. So thorough is the verisimilitude
of the poem, and so accurate are its descriptions of scenery, that the
events which it describes are accepted as absolute history in the region where the
scene is laid; and no true Highlander looks with tolerance on anyone who ventures
to doubt their actual occurrence. It has happened, therefore, that the romantic poem
in which the genius of Scott has united and harmonised the legends of Loch Katrine
and the Trosachs has become the best Handbook to the Scottish Lake-region. It is
believed that the present Illustrated Edition will be a welcome souvenir to thousands
of travellers who have visited that beautiful region.</i></p>

<p><i>In order to secure accuracy as well as freshness of treatment, the Publishers commissioned</i>
Mr. <span class="smcap">A. V. S. Anthony</span>, <i>under whose supervision this Edition has been
executed, to visit the Scottish Highlands and make sketches on the spot. Nearly
every scene of the poem was personally visited and sketched by him, and these
Sketches have afforded the basis of the landscapes offered in this book. These landscapes,
for obvious reasons, depict the Scenery as it is at the present time; while the
Costumes, Weapons, and other accessories of the figure-pieces are of the period of the
action of the poem, being carefully studied from contemporary pictures and descriptions,
or from later authoritative works.</i></p>

<p><i>This sumptuous and elegant Birthday Book is the first in which our floral
treasures have been laid under really effective contribution. It has been produced at
immense cost, and in it we have one of the most accurate and beautiful Masterpieces
of Chromo-lithography yet issued from the press. Within its sixty-four fully-coloured
pages, each lithographed in fourteen printings, we have a noble Series of lovely Bouquets,
depicting in all their wealth of grace and beauty the most famous of our field
and garden jewels; as a different flower is taken for every day in the year, there
are no fewer than three hundred and sixty-six separate selections. The legends
and the sentiments ascribed to each of the chosen blossoms have formed the theme of
some fifteen hundred lines of Original Verse, and there is thus given one of the fullest
"Languages of Flowers" in existence, and the only one which is free from duplicates.
An unusual amount of thought and labour has been expended on the work, and the
publishers congratulate themselves that in a literary and artistic sense the result has
been fully commensurate thereto. Such a collection of flowers, so complete and compact,
has never before been offered. As a Book of Birthdays and Family Records it
is unsurpassed. The addition of the scientific names to the minutely accurate delineations
of plants renders its pages invaluable to the botanist and every lover of leaf and
bloom. The legends which form the burden of its verse will delight the scholar and
archæologist and all students of song and folk-lore; while the copious floral meanings,
completer than in any other "language of flowers" yet available, will render it
the constant companion and most treasured gift of a much more numerous section of
the community&mdash;the whole world of Sweethearts of the English-speaking nations.</i></p>

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free

(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg-tm License available with this file or online at

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works

1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the
person or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph
1.E.8.

1.B. "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the
Foundation" or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when
you share it without charge with others.

1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country outside the United States.

1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work
on which the phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

  This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and
  most other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no
  restrictions whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it
  under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included with this
  eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org. If you are not located in the
  United States, you'll have to check the laws of the country where you
  are located before using this ebook.

1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms

contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
